# Verify that libarti_android.so builds reproducibly.
#
# Builds the Arti native library twice from a clean state and confirms the two
# outputs are byte-for-byte identical. Both builds compile in the canonical path
# (/tmp/amethyst-arti-build), so a match here means any checkout — ours,
# F-Droid's, an auditor's — produces the same bytes. See README.md →
# "Reproducible builds".
#
# Usage:
#   ./verify-reproducible.sh              # both ABIs (arm64-v8a + x86_64)
#   ./verify-reproducible.sh --release    # arm64-v8a only (faster)
#
# Prerequisites are the same as build-arti.sh (rustup, cargo-ndk, and the exact
# Android NDK revision pinned in ANDROID_NDK_VERSION — a different revision is
# refused, because it would change the output bytes).
# Exit 0 = reproducible, exit 1 = builds differ.
