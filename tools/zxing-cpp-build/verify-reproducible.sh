# Verify that libzxingcpp_android.so builds reproducibly.
#
# Builds the native library twice from a clean state into scratch directories
# and confirms the two outputs are byte-for-byte identical, then compares them
# against what is committed under jniLibs. Both builds compile in the canonical
# path, so a match here means any checkout -- ours, F-Droid's, an auditor's --
# produces the same bytes. See README.md -> "Reproducible builds".
#
# The second build runs against a copy of the NDK in a different directory. Two
# builds from the same NDK path cannot see a dependency on where the NDK lives,
# and that is exactly how the build-id leak got through: lld hashed debug info
# that named the NDK's install path, so F-Droid's rebuild differed from ours in
# 20 bytes while this script reported a perfect match. Each output is also
# checked for absolute paths, which is what such a leak usually looks like.
#
# Usage:
#   ./verify-reproducible.sh                  # every ABI
#   ./verify-reproducible.sh --abi arm64-v8a  # one ABI (faster)
#
# Exit 0 = reproducible and matching the commit, exit 1 = they differ.
