## Privacy and Information Permanence

Relays know your IP address, your name, your location (guessed from IP), your pub key, all your contacts, and other relays, and can read every action you do (post, like, boost, quote, report, etc) except for Private Zaps and Private DMs. While the content of direct messages (DMs) is only visible to you and your DM counterparty, everyone can see when you and your counterparty DM each other.

If you want to improve your privacy, consider utilizing a service that masks your IP address (e.g. a VPN or Tor) from trackers online.

The relay also learns which public keys you are requesting, meaning your public key will be tied to your IP address.

Information shared on Nostr can be re-broadcasted to other servers and should be assumed permanent for privacy purposes. There is no way to guarantee the deletion of any content once posted.

# Development Overview

This repository is split between Amethyst, Quartz, Commons, and DesktopApp:
- **Amethyst** - Native Android app with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose
- **Quartz** - Nostr-commons KMP library for protocol classes shared across platforms
- **Commons** - Kotlin Multiplatform module with shared UI components (icons, robohash, blurhash, composables)
- **DesktopApp** - Compose Multiplatform Desktop application reusing commons and quartz

The app architecture consists of the UI, which uses the usual State/ViewModel/Composition, the service layer that connects with Nostr relays,
and the model/repository layer, which keeps all Nostr objects in memory, in a full OO graph.

The repository layer stores Nostr Events as Notes and Users separately. Those classes use LiveData and Flow objects to
allow the UI and other parts of the app to subscribe to each Note/User and receive updates when they happen.
They are also responsible for updating viewModels when needed. As the user scrolls through Events, the Datasource classes
are updated to receive more information about those particular Events.

Most of the UI is reactive to changes in the repository classes. The service layer assembles Nostr filters for each need of the app,
receives the data from the Relay, and sends it to the repository. Connection with relays is never closed during the use of the app.
The UI receives a notification that objects have been updated. Instances of User and Notes are mutable directly.
There will never be two Notes with the same ID or two User instances with the same pubkey.

Lastly, the user's account information (private key/pub key) is stored in the Android KeyStore for security.

## Setup

Make sure to have the following pre-requisites installed:
1. Java 21+
2. Android Studio
3. Android 8.0+ Phone or Emulation setup

Fork and clone this repository and import it into Android Studio
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst.git
```

Use an Android Studio build action to install and run the app on your device or a simulator.

## Building

Build the Android app:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Build and run the Desktop app (requires Java 21+):
```bash
./gradlew :desktopApp:run
```

## Testing
```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Linting
```bash
./gradlew spotlessCheck
./gradlew spotlessApply
```

## Installing on device

For the F-Droid build:
```bash
./gradlew installFdroidDebug
```

For the Play build:
```bash
./gradlew installPlayDebug
```

## Deploying

1. Generate a new signing key
```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore <my-release-key.keystore> -alias <alias_name> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
openssl base64 < <my-release-key.keystore> | tr -d '\n' | tee some_signing_key.jks.base64.txt
```
2. Create four Secret Key variables on your GitHub repository and fill in the signing key information
    - `KEY_ALIAS` <- `<alias_name>`
    - `KEY_PASSWORD` <- `<your password>`
    - `KEY_STORE_PASSWORD` <- `<your key store password>`
    - `SIGNING_KEY` <- the data from `<my-release-key.keystore>`
3. Change the `versionCode` and `versionName` on `amethyst/build.gradle`
4. Commit and push.
5. Tag the commit with `v{x.x.x}`
6. Let the [Create Release GitHub Action](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst/actions/workflows/create-release.yml) build a new `aab` file.
7. Add your CHANGE LOG to the description of the new release
8. Download the `aab` file and upload it to the PlayStore.

## Using the Quartz library

### Installing

Add Maven Central and Google Maven to your repositories:

```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    google()
}
```

Add the following line to your `commonMain` dependencies:

```gradle
implementation('com.vitorpamplona.quartz:quartz:1:05.0')
```

Variations to each platform are also available:

```gradle
implementation('com.vitorpamplona.quartz:quartz-android:1:05.0')
implementation('com.vitorpamplona.quartz:quartz-jvm:1:05.0')
implementation('com.vitorpamplona.quartz:quartz-iosarm64:1:05.0')
implementation('com.vitorpamplona.quartz:quartz-iossimulatorarm64:1:05.0')
```

Check versions on [MavenCentral](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=com.vitorpamplona.quartz)

### How to use

Manage logged in users with the `KeyPair` class

```kt
val keyPair = KeyPair() // creates a random key
val keyPair = KeyPair("hex...".hexToByteArray())
val keyPair = KeyPair("nsec1...".bechToBytes())
val keyPair = KeyPair(Nip06().privateKeyFromMnemonic("<mnemonic>"))
val readOnly = KeyPair(pubKey = "hex...".hexToByteArray())
val readOnly = KeyPair(pubKey = "npub1...".bechToBytes())
```

Create signers that can be Internal, when you have the private key or a read-only public key,
or External, when it is controlled by Amber in NIP-55.

Use either the `NostrSignerInternal` or `NostrSignerExternal` class:

```kt
val signer = NostrSignerInternal(keyPair)
val amberSigner = NostrSignerExternal(
    pubKey = keyPair.pubKey.toHexKey(),
    packageName = signerPackageName, // Amber package name
    contentResolver = appContext.contentResolver,
)
```

Create a single `NostrClient` for the entire application and control which relays it will access by
registering subscriptions and sending events. The pool will automatically change based on filters +
outbox events.

You will need a coroutine scope to process events and if you are using OKHttp, we offer a basic
wrapper to create the socket connections themselves.

```kt
val appScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default + SupervisorJob())
val rootClient = OkHttpClient.Builder().build()
val socketBuilder = BasicOkHttpWebSocket.Builder { url -> rootClient }

val client = NostrClient(socketBuilder, appScope)
```

If you want to auth, given a logged-in `signer`:

```kt
val authCoordinator = RelayAuthenticator(client, appScope) { authTemplate ->
    listOf(
        // for each signed-in user, return an event
        signer.sign(authTemplate)
    )
}
```

To make a request subscription simply do:

```kt
val metadataSub = client.req(
    relay = "wss://nos.lol",
    filter = Filter(
        kinds = listOf(MetadataEvent.KIND),
        authors = listOf(signer.pubkey)
    )
) { event ->
    /* consume event */
}
```

The client will add the relay to the pool, connect to it and start receiving events. The
`metadataSub` will be active until you call `metadataSub.close()`. If the client disconnects
and reconnects, the sub will be active again.

To manage subscriptions that change over time, the simplest approach is to build mutable
subscriptions with a filters lambda that you can change at will.

```kt
val metadataSub = client.req(
    filters = {
        // Let's say you have a list of users that need to be rendered
        val users = pubkeysSeeingInTheScreen()
        // And a cache repository with their outbox relays
        val outboxRelays = outboxRelays(users)

        val filters = listOf(
            Filter(
                kinds = listOf(MetadataEvent.KIND),
                authors = users
            )
        )

        outboxRelays.associateWith { filters }
    }
) { event ->
    /* consume event */
}
```

In that way, you can simply call `metadataSub.updateFilter()` when you need to update
subscriptions to all relays. Or call `metadataSub.close()` to stop the sub
without deleting it.

When your app goes to the background, you can use NostrClient's `connect` and `disconnect`
methods to stop all communication to relays. Add the `connect` to your `onResume` and `disconnect`
to `onPause` methods.
