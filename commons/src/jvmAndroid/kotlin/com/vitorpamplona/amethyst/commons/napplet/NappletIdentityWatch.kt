/**
 * Streams `identity.changed` pushes to an applet that registered `napplet.identity.onChanged`. It
 * collects the active user's public key ([pubKey]) and, on every *subsequent* change (the current
 * value is dropped — the applet already has it via `getPublicKey`), encodes and pushes the new key
 * (or `""` when no account is signed in) to the caller-supplied sink.
 *
 * Watches are keyed by the trusted launch token so concurrent surfaces cannot replace each other's
 * streams. A watch starts only after that surface successfully obtains its public-key snapshot.
