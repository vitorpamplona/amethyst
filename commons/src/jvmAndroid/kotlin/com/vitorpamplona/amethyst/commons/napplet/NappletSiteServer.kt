/**
 * What a host serves for one napplet or nSite, whatever its browser: the trusted shell on
 * [NappletWebContract.SHELL_URL] and the launch's verified files on its own [appOrigin]. Android's
 * WebView and the desktop's Chromium only translate requests in and [Response]s out, so the rules
 * below can't drift between them.
 *
 * - A NIP-5D napplet's shell carries its sole `/index.html` as an opaque-origin `srcdoc`, with the
 *   prelude injected outside its aggregate hash; its requests anywhere else are 404s.
 * - A NIP-5A site's shell frames [appOrigin]. Every file there is a verified blob from its event;
 *   a document navigation to a path the event doesn't list falls back to `/`, so client-side routes
 *   survive deep links and reloads, while a missing script or image stays a 404. HTML gets the
 *   prelude with NIP-07. Requests to other hosts are the browser's to send ([serve] returns null).
