/**
 * The relays this account said "log in" to during **this run of the app**, without asking to
 * remember the answer permanently.
 *
 * A NIP-42 challenge is not a one-off event: relays re-challenge on every reconnect, and a client
 * that drops its socket on network changes, doze, or an app switch reconnects constantly. Answering
 * the dialog only for the single in-flight challenge therefore meant the same relay asked the same
 * question again minutes later — the prompt fatigue that makes users reach for "always allow" on a
 * relay they only wanted to try once. Holding the grant in memory keeps the answer alive for exactly
 * as long as the user is plausibly still doing the thing they answered for.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** persisted: it is dropped when the process dies (this object lives on
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.Account], which is built per process) and when the account is
 * logged out, so the next cold start asks again. That is the whole difference from
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.relayauth.RelayAuthDecision.ALLOW], which the "remember"
 * switch writes to disk.
 *
 * Scoped per account because the grant authorizes revealing *one* identity: the prompt names whose
 * npub is at stake, so account B is never covered by an answer given for account A.
