 * would make each save write null over them, and the group save uses

 * group with its own save path cannot be wiped by a save that does not know
 * about it.
 *
 * # Why encrypted
 *
 * The whole point of the seed is that the identities derived from it are
 * unlinkable to the npub. Anyone who can read it can link every cell the user
 * has ever posted in, to each other and to the device, which is exactly what the
 * feature exists to prevent. It was in an encrypted file before; it stays in one.
