 * the people who decided most recently.
 *
 * A data class on purpose: the fold re-runs on every RSVP or appointment that lands, and value
 * equality is what lets the StateFlow drop a fold that changed nothing and lets an unchanged row
 * skip recomposition. [appointment] compares by identity, which is right — the cache hands out
 * one [AddressableNote] per address.

/**
 * Folds a pile of kind-31925 RSVPs into the appointments the accepted authors are going to.

 * - Only an author's **latest** RSVP to a given appointment counts. RSVPs are addressable with a
 *   free-form `d` tag, so a person who said "going" and later "can't go" may have two live events
 *   (two d-tags); the newest one is their answer.
 * - [isAttendee] runs on that latest RSVP only: the follow-list / mute check belongs to the caller.
 * - [isAppointmentVisible] runs on the appointment's address before it is resolved, so an event
 *   hosted by someone the viewer muted is neither drawn nor fetched.
 * - An appointment counts as upcoming while it has not ended (an ongoing multi-day conference is
 *   still somewhere your friends are), matching the feed lens's upcoming/past split.
 *
 * [nowSeconds] is a parameter so the split is deterministic under test.
