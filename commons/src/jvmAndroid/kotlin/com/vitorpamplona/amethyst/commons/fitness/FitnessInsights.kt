/**
 * The goal-oriented, historical view of the training log that the redesigned My Fitness screen
 * draws: progress against [FitnessGoals] this calendar week, the weekly series behind the trend
 * chart, the day-by-day grid behind the consistency heatmap, when in the week and the day the user
 * tends to train, how their activity mix is shifting, and their records.
 *
 * Where [WorkoutStats] looks at a rolling 28 days, this looks at calendar weeks over up to
 * [HISTORY_WEEKS]. Calendar weeks because a goal is "this week", and a rolling seven days moves
 * the goalposts every morning. Longer because patterns need history: a weekday profile from four
 * weeks is four samples per bar. The older weeks come from the user's published kind 1301s only —
 * Health Connect serves 30 days — which [Insights.deviceHorizon] marks so the chart can say so.
 *
 * Pure and platform-free like [WorkoutStats], so every number on the screen is testable.
