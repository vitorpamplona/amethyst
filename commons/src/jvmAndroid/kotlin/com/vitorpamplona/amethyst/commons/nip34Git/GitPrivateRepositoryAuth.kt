/**
 * GRASP-08 auth for the clone URLs of private repositories the cache knows (an announcement
 * tagged `["private", "true"]`): their git requests carry the user's signed `Authorization`;
 * every other repository's go without one, so nothing is signed for a public server.
 *
 * Only a URL under the announcer's own GRASP path (`https://<server>/<their npub>/…`) counts: a
 * stranger's announcement can call any URL private, and signing for it would tell that host who
 * the user is. Each URL's answer is kept for [rememberSeconds], so a fetch's many requests (blame,
 * search) do not each walk every repository in the cache.
