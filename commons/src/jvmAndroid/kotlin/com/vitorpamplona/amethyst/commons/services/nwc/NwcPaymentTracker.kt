/**
 * Tracks pending NIP-47 (Nostr Wallet Connect) payment requests awaiting responses.
 *
 * Shared between Android and Desktop to provide consistent payment tracking behavior.
 * Platform-specific caches (LocalCache, DesktopLocalCache) delegate to this tracker
 * for the core request/response matching logic.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. When sending payment request: [registerRequest] stores callback and the
 *    expected wallet-service pubkey
 * 2. When response arrives: [onResponseReceived] retrieves the pending request
 *    only if the response author matches the expected wallet-service pubkey
 * 3. Caller invokes callback and links notes via Note.addZapPayment()
 *
 * Author verification is required because the relay subscription filters by
 * request id only (matching Primal's filter shape). An attacker who observes
 * the request on the relay could otherwise forge a response with their own
 * keypair and trick the client into displaying attacker-controlled data.
