     * published event may have dropped (heart rate, steps, climb), and its start time is the
     * recorded one rather than a publish timestamp.
     *
     * That preference is only justified while the Health Connect copy actually has those metrics.
     * It can arrive without them — its per-session aggregations are read separately and may not
     * have come back yet, or may have failed — and then it is strictly worse than the published
     * event it would displace. So a copy carrying no metric at all yields to a matching one that
     * does, rather than evicting it and taking numbers off the screen. See
     * [DetectedWorkout.hasAnyMetric].

     * The winner keeps the loser's one piece of information: that a kind 1301 for this workout
     * exists. Dropping the published copy would otherwise lose that fact, and the survivor —
     * still flagged as Health Connect data — would read as never posted. See
