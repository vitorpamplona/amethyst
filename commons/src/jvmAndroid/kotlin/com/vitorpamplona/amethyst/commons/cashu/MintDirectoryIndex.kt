package com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.cashu

import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap

/**
 * In-memory directory of Cashu mint URLs the app has seen on the network,
 * sibling to `LocalCache.relayHints`. Used to offer autocomplete in any
 * text field where the user types a mint URL — typing "min" suggests
 * mints other nostr users have already published in a kind:10019
 * (`NutzapInfoEvent`), kind:38000 (`MintRecommendationEvent`), or kind:38172
 * (`CashuMintEvent`), so the user doesn't have to memorise URLs.
 *
 * Population is passive — `LocalCache.updateMintIndex(event)` adds entries
 * as events flow through `justConsumeAndUpdateIndexes`. Entries are never
 * removed: the index is a best-effort suggestion source, not authoritative,
 * and a still-listed mint URL never hurts (the user can always tap Verify
 * before adding it). Each call to [add] increments a counter that
 * [suggest] uses to rank popular mints first.
 *
 * Normalisation: incoming URLs are trimmed, lower-cased, and the trailing
 * `/` is stripped so `https://Mint.Example.com/` and `https://mint.example.com`
 * collapse to the same entry. URLs that don't carry an `http://` or
 * `https://` scheme are dropped — autocomplete on garbage tags would
 * surface noise.
 *
 * Thread-safe via `ConcurrentHashMap`; safe to call from any dispatcher.
