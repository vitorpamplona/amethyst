/**
 * An encrypted-at-rest log of UTF-8 entries that can be appended to in
 * constant time.
 *
 * ```
 * file    := MAGIC(8) foldedLength(uint64) segment*
 * segment := uint32 encLen, byte[encLen]        // whatever [encrypt] produces
 * plain   := uint32 count, (uint32 len, byte[len])*
 * ```
 *
 * Segments are the whole point. The format this replaces was a single blob
 * covering the entire history, so recording one line meant pushing every line
 * ever written back through the cipher and out to disk again — work that grew
 * with the log and, for Marmot's message log, was paid on the send path. A
 * conversation a few thousand messages long was moving hundreds of KB through
 * a hardware-backed cipher to append a couple of hundred bytes.
 *
 * Appending writes one small segment. Every [compactAfterSegments] appends the
 * loose run — everything past `foldedLength` — is folded into a single segment,
 * which bounds how many cipher round trips a read costs. A fold re-encrypts
 * only the run it collapses; the already-folded prefix is copied across as
 * ciphertext, so no append ever pays for the whole history.
 *
 * `foldedLength` lives in the header rather than in memory so that bound
 * survives a restart. Held only in memory, every session would treat whatever
 * it found as already folded, leave its own run permanently unfoldable, and
 * segments would creep back towards one per message — which is the cost the
 * fold exists to prevent.
 *
 * A file written by the older format has no magic prefix and is read as a
 * single legacy blob; the next append rewrites it in this format.
 *
 * **Not thread-safe.** Entries are cached in memory so an append never has to
 * read the log back, and that cache assumes one owner. Callers hold their own
 * lock around every method (see `EncryptedMarmotMessageStore`), and one instance
 * must own any given file.
 *
 * @param encrypt must produce a self-describing blob — it carries its own IV /
 *   nonce, since every segment is encrypted separately.
 * @param decrypt MUST return null rather than throwing for a segment it cannot
 *   open. One unreadable segment then costs only its own entries; a throw would
 *   abort the whole read, and a caller that reads an empty log can overwrite a
 *   history that was merely unreadable.
