/**
 * Reusable **per-relay backward pagination** engine: pages a set of relays back through history,
 * **one page at a time, per relay, on demand**, by `until`+`limit` ([RelayLoadingCursors]) — with each
 * relay advancing independently the moment *it* settles, never paced by the slowest one.
 *
 * This is the **single-active orchestrator** around the paging state. The state itself (the per-relay
 * [RelayLoadingCursors]) does NOT live here — the caller holds it on whatever object owns the scope, so
 * its lifetime matches that object. One orchestrator drives whichever scope is currently bound; calling
 * [bind] repoints it at that scope's cursors. This is safe as long as the caller only advances the bound
 * scope (e.g. the one the user is viewing), so a backgrounded scope produces no callbacks to mis-route.
 *
 * What it owns (all transient, recomputed on each [bind]): the in-flight + silence tracking
 * ([PerRelayLoadTracker]), the stalled-relay set, and the display flows — one atomic [status] snapshot
 * ([PagingStatus]) plus the separately-debounced [loadingMore]. The persistent cursors and the pinned
 * history floor live on the bound [RelayLoadingCursors].
 *
 * What it does NOT own (the caller supplies these — they are protocol- and framework-specific):
 *  - **Building the actual REQ filters.** The caller reads [armedRelays] + [requestedUntilFor] and
 *    assembles its own `RelayBasedFilter`s (the kinds / authors / `#p` tags differ per query).
 *  - **The subscription lifecycle.** The caller wires its `INostrClient` subscription and forwards
 *    relay callbacks here via [onEvent] / [onEose] / [onClosed] / [onCannotConnect], then re-issues
 *    its filter after [advance] / [advanceAll] return true.
 *  - **Which scope's cursors + which relays.** Supplied together by [bind].
 *
 * ### Done vs stalled (read [exhausted] with care)
 * A relay is **done** once it answers an empty page (gap-proof: nothing older). A relay that won't
 * answer right now — auth CLOSE, unreachable, or silent past the tracker's window — is flagged
 * **stalled** but kept (its subscription stays open; re-[advance] retries it). [exhausted] flips true
 * once every relay is *done or stalled* — "nothing more reachable right now", which is NOT the same as
 * "fully caught up". Callers that render a terminal state should split on [stalledCount]: `exhausted &&
 * stalledCount == 0` is genuinely caught up; `exhausted && stalledCount > 0` stopped early and may be
 * missing messages.
 *
 * Not internally synchronized beyond the primitives it composes; intended to be driven from one owning
 * scope with relay callbacks serialized per relay (as the relay IO layer delivers them).
