/**
 * OkHttp interceptor that transparently rewrites media downloads of
 * sha256-keyed blobs to a local Blossom cache running on `127.0.0.1:24242`,
 * per https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom/blob/master/implementations/local-blossom-cache.md
 *
 * This is the only place feed media, videos and profile pictures are routed
 * to the cache: callers keep the real URL, so the Tor decision, Coil/ExoPlayer
 * cache keys and decryption-key lookups all see the origin.
 *
 * Bridging is **opt-in**: only requests the media loaders mark with the
 * [MEDIA_HEADER] header are considered (see [LocalBlossomMediaCallFactory]).
 * Anything else whose last path segment merely looks like a hash — a BUD-02
 * `GET /list/<pubkey>`, uploads, deletes, `HEAD` presence checks — must reach
 * its server. The marker header is always stripped, so no server ever sees it;
 * that is why Tor-proxied clients carry a non-bridging instance ([bridges] =
 * false) instead of none: Tor-routed media skips the cache but is still cleaned.
 *
 * A marked `GET` is rewritten when [shouldBridge] returns `true`, it carries no
 * `Authorization` (an auth-gated blob goes to the host the token was signed
 * for), its last path segment is `<sha256>[.ext]`, and the host isn't already
 * the cache. The original scheme+host(+path prefix) is passed as the `xs=`
 * hint so the cache can fetch upstream on miss.
 *
 * Encrypted blobs are looked up in [keyCache] by URL after this interceptor
 * runs, so their decryption key is registered under the rewritten URL too.
 *
 * When the cache refuses the connection (the app was closed since the last
 * probe), [onUnreachable] is told so the bridge can switch off, and the
 * request falls back to its original URL instead of failing.
