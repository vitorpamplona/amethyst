/**
 * The handful of things the event cache needs from the application shell around it.
 *
 * The cache itself is a plain in-memory store and can run without any of them, so every
 * member here has a default that is the honest answer for a host that does not provide it
 * — an own scope, nowhere to spill NIP-95 blobs, no relay identity, no stats sink. A front end
 * installs its own via [EventCache.appHost]; Android's `Amethyst` does so at startup,
 * Desktop and unit tests keep the defaults.
 *
 * This exists so [LocalCache] can live in `commons` without naming `Amethyst.instance`,
 * `BuildConfig` or `android.os.Looper`.
 *
 * **Android's `:napplet` process must never reach the cache.** Now that [LocalCache] lives
 * in `commons`, `:nappletHost` can see it, where before it could not compile a reference at
 * all. A stray one there would no longer fail fast on an unset `Amethyst.instance` — it
 * would quietly build a second, empty cache in that process, with its own IO scope nothing
 * cancels. Processes share no memory: the populated cache exists only in `main`.
