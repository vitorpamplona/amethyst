 * Infers *why* a relay wants NIP-42 auth from what Amethyst is currently doing with it — the
 * events pending delivery and the active subscription filters (both from the [INostrClient]).
 * Pure so it can be unit-tested without the relay client.
 *
 * Sends (from the outbox) are read from the events themselves:
 *
 * - a pending Concord plane wrap (recognized by [venueForPlaneAuthor], since the wrap is *signed* by
 *   the plane's stream key) => [AuthPurposeKind.POST_VENUE] for that community;
 * - a pending `h`-tagged event => [AuthPurposeKind.POST_VENUE] for that NIP-29 relay group (except
 *   the [MLS_GROUP_KINDS], whose `h` names something unnameable);
 * - a pending gift wrap (kind 1059) => sending a DM to its `p` recipient ([AuthPurposeKind.SEND_DM]);
 * - a pending channel/community/live post => [AuthPurposeKind.POST_VENUE] for that venue;
 * - any other pending event with `p` tags => delivering it to those users' inboxes ([AuthPurposeKind.NOTIFY_INBOX]).
 *
 * The two room rules come first because both would otherwise be read as something else entirely: a
 * Concord wrap is kind 1059 `p`-tagged to a *throwaway* pubkey, so the gift-wrap rule would explain a
 * community post as a DM to a stranger nobody can name, and a NIP-29 chat message mentioning someone
 * would be explained as a notification rather than as a message into the group.
 *
 * Reads prefer the purpose the subscription **declared**. Assemblers build every filter as an
 * [ExplainedFilter] carrying a [SubPurpose][com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.relayClient.subscriptions.SubPurpose]
 * and the entity ids it serves, so we simply read it (see `toAuthPurposeKind`). That is the only way
 * to recognize the two states tag shape cannot express — reading your own inbox (`#p` = me, no
 * `authors`) and reading a thread's engagement (`#e` against note ids, shape-identical to a NIP-28
 * channel read). A filter that isn't an [ExplainedFilter], or whose purpose says nothing about
 * identity, falls back to the tag-shape rules:
 *
 * - a filter with `authors` => reading those authors' posts ([AuthPurposeKind.READ_OUTBOX]);
 * - a filter with `#e`/`#a` venue tags => reading a venue ([AuthPurposeKind.READ_VENUE]);
 * - anything else we're actively doing but can't attribute => [AuthPurposeKind.OTHER], so the relay
 *   is prompted about instead of silently failing.
