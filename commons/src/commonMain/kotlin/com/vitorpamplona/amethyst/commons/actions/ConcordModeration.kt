/**
 * Builds the Control Plane editions (CORD-04) that drive roles and moderation:
 * defining a role, granting roles to a member, and banning/unbanning members.
 *
 * Each is a kind-3308 edition, plaintext-sealed (so the author signature survives
 * re-encryption across epochs) and wrapped on the community's Control Plane. The
 * caller passes the community's **current** editions so this can chain the next
 * version onto the entity's head (`version = head.version + 1`, `prevHash =
 * head.hash`, a new entity starting at version 1) and read the banlist. Authority is
 * enforced at *fold* time by the `AuthorityResolver`, not here — an edition whose
 * author doesn't outrank its target is simply dropped by every client.
 *
 * Every non-owner edition carries the `vac` authority citation (CORD-04 §1/§5): the
 * actor's own Grant head as the same [current] editions fold it
 * ([AuthorityCitations.forActor]), which every reader, the reference client included,
 * requires before honoring the action. The owner cites nothing. A caller may still pass
 * an explicit [AuthorityCitation] to override it.
 *
 * The CORD-04 §2 / CORD-02 §6 caps ([ConcordLimits]) are enforced here too: an edition
 * every reader would drop is refused with an [IllegalArgumentException] rather than
 * published.

     *
     * Two traps live here, and both need the fold:
     *
     * 1. [current] arrives in **wrap-arrival order**, which is not chain order — so the

     *    the newest. Chaining off that stale edition forks the chain at an already-used
     *    version, silently dropping the change.
     * 2. The *ungated* structural tip may be an edition every reader **rejects**. Building
     *    on it does two kinds of damage: the rogue's version number is inflated into every
     *    honest edition that follows, and — for a replaced document like the banlist —
     *    the rogue's *content* is read as the current state and re-published under an
     *    authorized signature. That launders the attack: an unauthorized empty banlist
     *    becomes an owner-signed one the moment the owner bans anybody else.
     *
     * Armada's writers chain off `folded.heads` (its `pickHead` gated pick) for exactly
     * this reason; [ConcordCommunityState.authorizedHeads] is the same notion here.
