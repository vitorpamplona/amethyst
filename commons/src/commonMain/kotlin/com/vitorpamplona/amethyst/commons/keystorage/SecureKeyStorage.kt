/**
 * Secure storage for private keys using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms.
 *
 * ## Platform Implementations
 *
 * **Android:** Android Keystore + EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256-GCM, StrongBox when available)
 *
 * **Desktop:** OS native credential managers (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service)
 * with encrypted file fallback.
 *
 * ## Security Considerations
 *
 * **String Memory Limitation:** Private keys are returned as String (hexadecimal format). Unlike char arrays,
 * Kotlin/JVM Strings are immutable and cannot be securely zeroed from memory after use. The private key
 * will remain in memory until garbage collected, which may be delayed. This is an inherent limitation of
 * the JVM platform.
 *
 * **Mitigation:** Private keys are only exposed through this API when needed for signing operations.
 * They are encrypted at rest on all platforms. For maximum security, minimize the time private keys
 * are held in memory and ensure they are dereferenced promptly after use.
 *
 * **Production Recommendation:** For high-security applications, consider using hardware security modules
 * (HSM) or secure enclaves (Android StrongBox, iOS Secure Enclave) that never expose private keys to
 * application memory.
 *
 * Use [SecureKeyStorage.create] factory method to create instances.
