/**
 * One chess board, read from LocalCache.
 *
 * The game is its start note plus the moves linked to it as replies, so it is rebuilt whenever a
 * move lands, whether it came from the board's relay subscription, the lobby's, or the user's own
 * publish. There is no game state of its own to keep in sync: a move is signed, consumed into
 * LocalCache and broadcast like any other event, and the board redraws from what arrived.
