/**
 * What a search *is*, minus where its results come from.
 *
 * Both front ends had grown their own copy of this — the text, the parse, the debounce, the
 * scope, the sort orders, "is there anything to say yet" — and the copies disagreed on every one
 * of them. Android parsed the same string about nine times per keystroke across four different
 * debounce windows; desktop parsed once but had no scope at all. Neither difference was a
 * decision.
 *
 * So it lives here once, and each front end keeps only what is genuinely its own: how it asks for
 * results (a cache scan on Android, relay callbacks on desktop), what result kinds it can render,
 * and its own screen.
 *
 * ## The text is the query
 *
 * There is exactly one authority for what is being searched, and it is [text] — what is in the
 * box. [edit] exists for controls that build a filter without typing (a kind picker, a form
 * panel), and all it does is write the token into the box: the reader sees the same text they
 * could have typed, can edit it by hand, and the chips they see are that text rendered. Desktop
 * carried a `ChangeSource` flag to decide whether to show the raw text or the serialized query;
 * with the box authoritative there is nothing to decide.
 *
 * CLI-safe: flows and data, no Compose.
