/**
 * The rooms an account joined that the NIP-51 venue lists don't describe: NIP-29 relay groups (the
 * kind-10009 list) and Concord communities (the kind-13302 list).
 *
 * Both are venues in the "…it's my relay, or a room I joined" sense, and both are invisible to every
 * other signal in the auth path — a NIP-29 group's content is `#h`-scoped and never names the user,
 * and a Concord plane is authored by and addressed to derived stream keys — so this is what feeds
 * them to [RelayAuthPermissionLedger] and [RelayAuthFirstParty]. Pure, so the id/url matching is
 * testable without an [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.Account].
 *
 * Everything here is per account, deliberately: these lists come off *this* account's own list events,
 * so one account's rooms can never grant another account's identity away. That rules out the
 * process-wide joined sets (Buzz workspaces) — they carry no account, so folding them in here would
 * auto-authenticate every logged-in account on a workspace only one of them joined.
