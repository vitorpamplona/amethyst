/**
 * Buzz-only overlay state for one workspace channel: the newest kind-40100 canvas.
 * (Kind-40003 message edits are no longer tracked here — like every other edit kind
 * they are anchored on the message they edit via `Note.edits`.)
 *
 * This lives OUTSIDE the channel object on purpose. Screens, feed filters, and
 * composers capture their `RelayGroupChannel` instance once and hold it for the whole
 * session, so a channel can never be swapped for a "Buzz-typed" replacement when the
 * dialect is discovered mid-session — every live reference would keep rendering the
 * orphaned instance. Keeping the overlay in a registry keyed by the channel id makes
 * dialect discovery a non-event for object identity.
 *
 * The mutation is guarded by a per-state lock: consume runs on multiple relay dispatcher
 * threads, and unsynchronized check-then-act would let an older canvas overwrite a newer one.
