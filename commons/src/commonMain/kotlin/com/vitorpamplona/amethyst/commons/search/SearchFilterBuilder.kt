/**
 * A [SearchQuery] as the REQ a search sends: NIP-01 filters, ORed inside one subscription.
 *
 * Every token the field draws as a chip becomes a *filter field* here, not a NIP-50 search
 * extension — `#p`, `#e`, `#a`, `#t`, `#l`, `#h`, `#i`/`#I`, `since`/`until` — so a relay applies
 * them as index lookups and is left to rank only the free text. That is what lets a chip narrow
 * a search without fighting the relay's own relevance ordering.
 *
 * Most of the shape here is one question: which tag does this token actually get asked with?
 * A hashtag is three (`#t` on the event, `#l` on a label, `#i`/`#I` on a comment written about
 * it), and those cannot go in one filter — a single filter ANDs its tag fields, which would ask
 * for events carrying all three at once. So they fan out into a union instead, and the secondary
 * arms take a smaller limit because a relay applies `limit` per filter.
