/**
 * The search box: a plain text field that draws the tokens it holds as chips, with the picker
 * that the caret's position calls for underneath it.
 *
 * The field's value stays the text the reader typed — chips are a *rendering* of it, never a
 * replacement — so the box can be selected, copied, pasted back and shared as a url, and a query
 * always survives that round trip. See [SearchTokenTransformation] for how the chips are drawn
 * and [SearchFieldState] for how the caret decides which picker is open.
 *
 * While a picker is up it owns the arrow keys and Enter: those keys are walking the offered rows,
 * not the text. When no picker is up they fall through to the field and to [onSubmit].
 *
 * The rows are supplied by the caller — as [people]/[groups], or as a whole [peoplePicker] slot —
 * because resolving a name to a key is an account-scoped, relay-backed question that `commons`
 * has no business answering. This component only says *when* to ask, via [onPeopleQuery] and
 * [onGroupQuery], and what a pick splices into the text.
