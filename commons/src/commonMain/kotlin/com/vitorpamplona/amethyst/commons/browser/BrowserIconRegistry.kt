/**
 * Device-local favicon store for browsed sites, keyed by host. Favicons are **captured from the WebView
 * that already loaded the page** — on Android, in the keyless `:napplet` browser host, where they ride the
 * page's own (Tor-routed) network path — and handed here as PNG bytes; this is the privacy-preserving
 * alternative to the app fetching `host/favicon.ico` itself, which would bypass Tor and leak the visit.
 * Used to decorate favorite cards and omnibox suggestion rows.
 *
 * Bytes are persisted as one small PNG per host under [iconDir], so the only in-memory state is [keys] —
 * the set of hosts that currently have an icon — which exists purely to drive Compose recomposition (and
 * to keep filesystem existence checks out of composition).
 *
 * [iconDir] is a function rather than a path for the same reason [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.model.preferences.AppPreferenceStores]
 * takes `rootFilesDir`: the front end owns where its files live, and resolving it lazily keeps this class
 * free of any platform's notion of an app directory. The Android app passes
 * `{ appContext.filesDir.toOkioPath() / DIR }`.
 *
 * One instance per process. On Android the launcher/UI in the **main** process own it; the keyless
 * `:napplet` sandbox never builds one and relays captured bytes over IPC instead.
