 * Query state for the NIP-60 / NIP-61 wallet subscription.
 *
 * `pubkey` is the wallet owner — used both as `authors=` for their own
 * NIP-60 events and as the `#p` tag value for inbound nutzaps.
 *
 * The two filters read from different relay sets, following the NIP-65
 * outbox model:
 *  - [ownEventRelays] — the user's own write/outbox relays, where they
 *    published their NIP-60 wallet/token/history events. Restoring those
 *    means reading from where they were written.
 *  - [inboxRelays] — where *other* people deliver kind:9321 nutzaps to this
 *    user. Per NIP-61 the source of truth is the `relay` tags in the user's
 *    own kind:10019; in practice we listen on the union of those plus the
 *    user's NIP-65 inbox + DM relays so a nutzap can't slip past us.

/**
 * The filter used to **page** the account's whole proof set back from a relay,
 * as opposed to [cashuWalletFilters], which opens a live subscription.
 *
 * The live subscription sends one REQ with no `limit` and takes whatever the
 * relay decides to give back. Relays cap an unbounded REQ (NIP-11
 * `limitation.max_limit`, or a hard-coded default) and serve the **newest**
 * events within that cap, so a wallet whose kind:7375 events are outnumbered
 * by its kind:7376 history — which is every wallet after a few hundred
 * transactions — silently receives only a suffix of its proofs. Everything
 * downstream (balance, per-mint balances, coin selection) is a pure function
 * of that suffix, which is why two devices on the same account can show two
 * different balances and neither is right.
 *
 * There is no way to detect the truncation from the REQ itself: a capped
 * response and a complete one both just EOSE. The only fix is to not rely on
 * one REQ — hand this to `fetchAllPages` / `fetchAllPagesFromPool`, which
 * walks `until` cursors until a page comes back empty and thereby reaches
 * events of any age regardless of the cap.
 *
 * Scoped to kind:7375 alone. Those are the events that carry money; history,
 * quotes and recommendations are display-only, and paging them too would
 * multiply the download for a wallet with a long history without changing a
 * single balance. A caller that wants the rest — a headless client with no
 * scrolling list to page for it — asks for [cashuOwnEventBackfillFilters].
