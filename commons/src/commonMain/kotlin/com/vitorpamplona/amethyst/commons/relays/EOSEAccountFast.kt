/**
 * Per-key EOSE tracker keyed by an arbitrary [T] (a `User`, a pubkey, …), used
 * by the relay-subscription assemblers to remember which relays already EOSE'd
 * for a given key so the next filter assembly can add a `since` and avoid a full
 * re-download.
 *
 * KMP-pure: uses [KmpLock] instead of `synchronized(...)` so it compiles for the
 * iOS targets `commons` builds for. Moved out of `amethyst.service.relays` so the
 * shared user/event finder assemblers can live in `commonMain`. The old location
 * keeps a `typealias` for source compatibility.
