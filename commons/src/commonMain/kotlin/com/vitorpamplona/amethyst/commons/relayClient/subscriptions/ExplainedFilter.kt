/**
 * A [Filter] that also records **why** the app asked for it.
 *
 * The client tracks every in-flight REQ per relay already (`INostrClient.activeRequests`), but a
 * filter only says *what* is being matched — kinds, authors, tags. That is not enough to answer the
 * question a user (or a developer chasing relay churn) actually has: *which of my relays are doing
 * which job?* Carrying [purpose] on the filter itself means the answer travels with the data the
 * relay screens already read, with no parallel registry to keep in sync or to leak on teardown.
 *
 * ## It never reaches a relay
 *
 * `FilterSerializer` is registered against [Filter] and writes an explicit protocol field list
 * (`kinds`/`ids`/`authors`/`#tags`/`&tagsAll`/`since`/`until`/`limit`/`search`). Jackson applies a
 * serializer registered for a class to its subclasses, so an [ExplainedFilter] serializes to
 * byte-identical JSON — the purpose is dropped at the wire boundary by construction, not by an
 * annotation someone can forget. `ExplainedFilterTest` pins that.
 *
 * This matters beyond tidiness: telling relays what each REQ is *for* would hand them a
 * ready-made fingerprint of the client's intent, and correlate subscriptions that are deliberately
 * kept separate.
 *
 * ## Copying
 *
 * [copy] is overridden because filters are copied on the live path — assemblers call
 * `copy(since = …)` after every EOSE to advance the window. Inheriting the base implementation
 * would downgrade the filter to a plain [Filter] on the first refresh, so the purpose would survive
 * the opening REQ and then quietly disappear a few seconds later.
