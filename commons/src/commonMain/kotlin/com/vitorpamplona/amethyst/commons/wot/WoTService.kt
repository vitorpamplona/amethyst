/**
 * Friends-of-friends trust score computed from the active user's follow
 * graph. For every pubkey X the score is the count of accounts in the
 * active user's follow set who also follow X.
 *
 * ## Reactivity model
 *
 * Scores are exposed via a Compose-observable [SnapshotStateMap]. Consumers
 * that read a **single key** (`scores[pubkey]`) recompose only when that
 * key changes — this is `SnapshotStateMap`'s built-in per-key observation
 * and applies whether or not the writer wraps in a snapshot block.
 * Consumers that iterate the map or read `size` recompose on **any**
 * mutation.
 *
 * The writer wraps each op in [Snapshot.withMutableSnapshot] to *coalesce*
 * an op's writes into a single Compose commit — so a Kind3 op that
 * touches N reverse-index targets emits one invalidation, not N. It does
 * not confer additional per-key isolation on top of `SnapshotStateMap`'s
 * own semantics.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * All internal state is mutated from a single writer coroutine
 * ([writerLoop]) on [writerDispatcher] (default [Dispatchers.Default]), so
 * concurrent [applyKind3] / [onFollowSetChange] / [markReadyOnce] calls
 * from different threads are serialized without extra locking.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * Call [close] on account switch / logout so the writer coroutine exits
 * and the ops channel is released. Post-close ops are silently dropped.
