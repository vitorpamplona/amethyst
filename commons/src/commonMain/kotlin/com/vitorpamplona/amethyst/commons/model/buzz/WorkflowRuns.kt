 * The Buzz workflow run/step lifecycle events (46001-46012) carry only a channel `h` tag and a
 * free-form JSON `content` (they're relay-emitted and their content schema isn't pinned by Buzz).
 * This is the shape the Amethyst runner emits and the aggregator reads. The **run id is the
 * trigger event id**, and it doubles as the approval token — so an [ApprovalGrantEvent]'s `d`
 * tag equals the run id, and no separate token bookkeeping is needed.

 * content; an approval grant/deny (46030/46031) references the run via its `d` tag (= the token =
 * the run id). Pure and platform-agnostic — shared by the `amy` runner/CLI and the mobile app.
 *
 * This is Buzz's **source-confirmed** structured-work + human-approval primitive (the command
 * events 30620/46020/46030/46031 are pinned against buzz-relay's Rust handlers); the lifecycle
 * content shape is Amethyst's, since Buzz leaves it relay-defined. See
