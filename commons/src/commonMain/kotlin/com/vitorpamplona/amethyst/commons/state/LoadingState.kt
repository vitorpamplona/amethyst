/**
 * Generic loading state representation for async operations.
 *
 * Provides type-safe state management for loading, success, error, and empty states.
 * Eliminates the need for multiple boolean flags (isLoading, hasError, etc.).
 *
 * @param T The type of data when successfully loaded
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```
 * val feedState: StateFlow<LoadingState<List<Event>>> = ...
 *
 * when (val state = feedState.collectAsState().value) {
 *     is LoadingState.Idle -> { /* Not started yet */ }
 *     is LoadingState.Loading -> CircularProgressIndicator()
 *     is LoadingState.Success -> LazyColumn { items(state.data) { ... } }
 *     is LoadingState.Error -> ErrorMessage(state.message)
 *     is LoadingState.Empty -> EmptyPlaceholder()
 * }
 * ```
