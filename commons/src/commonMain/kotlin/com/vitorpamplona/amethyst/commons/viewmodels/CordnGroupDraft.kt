/**
 * A cordn group being filled in, across the screens that fill it in.
 *
 * The form outgrew one screen. Choosing who is in the group is a search, a
 * result list and a roster with a per-person admin toggle -- a screen's worth
 * of surface, and the thing every later step depends on, because which
 * coordinator can serve the group is decided by which of these people it holds
 * a KeyPackage for.
 *
 * Held in a ViewModel rather than in `remember` because a Compose Navigation
 * destination is disposed when you navigate off it: a half-typed name and a
 * finished discovery run would both be gone on the way back from picking
 * people. Scoped to the Activity by its caller (the same thing the chess lobby
 * and board do) so both screens see one draft, keyed per account so switching
 * accounts cannot inherit another one's roster.
 *
 * Deliberately headless and free of protocol: it holds what the user has typed
 * and nothing derived from a coordinator. Coverage -- who a coordinator can
 * actually reach -- is a live query each screen makes for itself, because
 * caching a "cannot be reached" here would outlive the truth of it.
