/**
 * A conversation only its members can read: a Marmot group, a Concord channel.
 *
 * The room owns its messages and everything said about them. A reaction, a deletion, a poll vote
 * or an admin removal of one of its messages travels inside the room, encrypted to its members,
 * and is kept with the room. None of it goes through the account's public paths, which publish
 * signed events naming the message to relays: Account refuses a note that is in a room
 * ([isInRoom]), so an action that forgets to ask the room fails instead of leaking.
 *
 * Shared UI reaches the room through the note ([roomFor]), never by asking which protocol the
 * note came from. Operations take the [Account] because a room can be shared by every account on
 * the device (a Concord channel lives in the global cache), while the keys to write in it are the
 * account's. Each returns false when nothing was sent.
