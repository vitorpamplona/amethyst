/**
 * Pure event-building "verbs" for the NIP-02 kind:3 contact list.
 *
 * Builds a signed [ContactListEvent] but does NOT publish it. The Amethyst
 * Android UI flow does more than these builders — non-UI callers are
 * responsible for the rest:
 *
 *  * **Publish.** Hand the returned event to your relay client. Android
 *    uses `Account.sendMyPublicAndPrivateOutbox`, amy uses `Context.publish`.
 *  * **Writeable check.** Skip the call when the active signer is read-only
 *    (e.g. an npub-only login). Building will fail at the sign step
 *    otherwise.
 *  * **Relay hint.** Pass [relayHint] pointing at one of the target's
 *    advertised kind:10002 write relays so readers can find the followed
 *    user. The in-app flow does this via `User.bestRelayHint()`.
 *  * **No-op detection.** When the user already follows the target, the
 *    underlying builder short-circuits to the same [currentContactList].
 *    Compare `result.id == currentContactList?.id` to detect this.
 *  * **Local cache update.** If your caller has a local event cache, feed
 *    the new event back in so the UI / next read sees the update without
 *    a relay round-trip.
 *
 * Canonical entry point for non-UI callers (CLI commands, Android App
 * Functions adapters, automation scripts): takes pubkeys as [HexKey] rather
 * than the UI-model `User`, so it has no cache or scope dependency and is
 * trivially testable.
