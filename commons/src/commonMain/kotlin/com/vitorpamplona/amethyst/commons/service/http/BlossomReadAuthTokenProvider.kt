/**
 * Signs and caches BUD-01 read-auth headers for auth-gated Blossom hosts.
 *
 * Signing never blocks a caller's thread. It runs on [scope]; callers either
 * `suspend` on [header] or fire [warm] and pick the token up later. That
 * matters because the consumer used to be [BlossomReadAuthInterceptor], which
 * runs on an OkHttp dispatcher thread — bridging the suspend signer with
 * `runBlocking` there held one of the 16 per-host dispatcher slots for as long
 * as the signer took (up to the timeout), so a feed's first burst against a
 * gated host could occupy every slot and stall every other image from it.
 *
 * One signature per host, however many callers. The token cache alone couldn't
 * provide that: it is only populated *after* a signature returns, so a cold
 * burst of N images all missed it and all signed concurrently — with a NIP-55
 * external signer that meant N IPC round trips (and potentially N prompts).
 * [inFlight] is what collapses them; the leader signs and every follower awaits
 * the same [CompletableDeferred].
 *
 * Tokens are cached per host, not per blob, and are therefore minted with a
 * BUD-11 `server` tag and **no** `x` tag. BUD-11 lists `x` as optional for
 * `GET /<sha256>` but is strict about what including one means: "When `x` tags
 * are present, the token is only valid for operations on the specified blob
 * hashes." A token carrying the hash of whichever blob happened to trigger
 * signing would therefore be invalid for every other blob it was reused for.
 * Server-scoped and hash-free, one signed event legitimately covers a whole
 * feed's worth of images from the host for the life of the token.
 *
 * The tradeoff that buys: the token authorizes reading any blob on that host
 * until it expires, rather than one. It is only ever sent to that host, over
 * TLS, and BUD-11 sanctions the shape — but it is a wider grant than a
 * per-blob token, which is the price of caching at all.
