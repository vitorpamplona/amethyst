/**
 * Durable NUT-13 deterministic-secret counter store, keyed by mint keyset id.
 *
 * Cashu NUT-13 derives blinded secrets from the wallet seed plus a per-keyset
 * monotonically increasing counter. Reusing a counter makes the mint reply
 * `outputs already signed`, so every reservation MUST be persisted **before**
 * the blinded outputs hit the mint. Implementations therefore make
 * [reserve] atomic and durable.
 *
 * - Android backs this with `AccountSettings` / `CashuPreferences`.
 * - `amy` backs this with `~/.amy/<account>/cashu.json`.
 *
 * `CashuWalletOps` consumes the two operations as plain function references
 * ([peek] / [reserve]); this interface gives both hosts one named contract.
