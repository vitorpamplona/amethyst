/**
 * A single, central enforcement point for the NIP-51 kind:10006 blocked relay list.
 *
 * Relay targeting in this app is fully distributed: every feed, loader, finder, and
 * publish path builds its own `Map<relay, filters>` (for REQ/COUNT) or relay set (for
 * publish) and hands it to [INostrClient]. Only a subset of those sites remembered to
 * subtract the blocked list, so blocked relays still leaked in through event/thread
 * loaders, the user-metadata finder, DM targeting, and the broadcast/publish path.
 *
 * Rather than patch every selection site (and re-open the same gap with every new
 * assembler), this decorator wraps the real client and strips blocked relays from the
 * three operations that open a socket — [subscribe], [count] and [publish] — right
 * before they reach the pool. Because the one-shot fetch helpers ([fetchAll],
 * [fetchFirst], [fetchAllPages], NIP-45 count, …) are extension functions that route
 * through [subscribe]/[count], wrapping the client covers them for free.
 *
 * [blockedRelays] is read on every call so the currently-active account's list always
 * applies, with no caching to invalidate on account switch.
 *
 * Note: the NIP-77 negentropy paths drive a single socket directly through
 * [getOrCreateRelay] with a caller-chosen relay; that escape hatch is delegated
 * unchanged, so callers that use it must keep filtering blocked relays themselves.
