/**
 * Narrow, read-only view of a logged-in account that the user-finder
 * subscription layer needs to route metadata / relay-list / report /
 * contact-card REQs for *other* users.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT part of [IAccount][com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.model.IAccount]:
 * `IAccount` is a behavioral capability interface for the *acting* user
 * (sending DMs, gift wraps, MLS groups). The relay hints needed to *discover
 * other users' metadata* are a separate concern, so they live on their own
 * narrow interface (ISP).
 *
 * All accessors are **snapshot getters** read fresh on every filter rebuild —
 * matching the prior direct `account.xxx.flow.value` reads. Relay-list changes
 * therefore take effect on the next subscription invalidation without any
 * captured-snapshot staleness.
 *
 * Platforms implement this on their concrete account (Android `Account`,
 * Desktop `DesktopIAccount`). Fields with no backing on a platform degrade
 * safely: Desktop has no NIP-85 trust-provider subsystem wired, so
 * [trustProvider] returns null and [declaredFollowsByOutboxRelay] returns an
 * empty map — contact-card and report discovery become best-effort there.
