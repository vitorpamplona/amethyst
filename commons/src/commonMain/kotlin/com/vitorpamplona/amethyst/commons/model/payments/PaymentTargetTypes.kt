/**
 * The NIP-A3 (`payto`) target-type vocabulary: how a free-text type string is
 * normalized, which types the app's own wallets already cover, and the URI a
 * type hands off to.
 *
 * Type strings come from user input ([PaymentTargetsViewModel.addTarget] only
 * trims and lowercases), so the space is unbounded — `iban`, `upi`, `pix`,
 * `swish` and whatever comes next all land here as themselves. The tables below
 * only collapse the aliases we know about; everything else passes through and
 * falls back to `payto://<type>/<authority>`.
 *
 * Single source of truth for three callers that would otherwise each keep their
 * own copy: the profile chips (which pay a target directly), the zap picker's
 * hand-off chip (which must exclude the types the wallet rails already own),
 * and the installed-app probe (which needs the URI before it has an authority).
