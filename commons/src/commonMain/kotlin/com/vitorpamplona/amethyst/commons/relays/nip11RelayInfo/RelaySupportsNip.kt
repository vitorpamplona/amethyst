/**
 * Whether [relayInfo] affirmatively signals that its relay does NOT run NIP-29 groups: the doc
 * resolved with an explicit `supported_nips` list that lacks "29" and no `self` key (the field
 * NIP-29 relays publish so clients can verify their relay-signed group metadata — see
 * [isRelaySignedRelayGroup]). A doc with a null `supported_nips` proves nothing (still loading,
 * or the fetch failed), so it never triggers the warning.
 *
 * Takes the resolved document rather than a relay URL, which is what makes it shared: the cache
 * lookup that produces one is the front end's business, the rule applied to it is not. The
 * convenience forms that read Amethyst's in-memory cache stay in the app.

/**
 * Whether [channel]'s relay-signed metadata is genuinely from its host relay, per NIP-29:
 * "these are addressable events signed by the relay keypair directly … as stated by the NIP-11
 * `self` pubkey", and "relays shouldn't accept these events if they're signed by anyone else".
 *
 * So the authoritative check is `39000.author == relay.self`. When the relay publishes a `self`
 * key we enforce that strictly — this rejects a stray user-published 39000 even on a real NIP-29
 * relay. When the relay does NOT advertise `self` at all (we can't verify cryptographically), we
 * fall back to the weaker "advertises NIP-29" signal so a compliant relay that merely omits `self`
 * still works. A relay with neither fails. Reads only the resolved doc ([relayInfo]); callers
 * driving a live surface should warm it first and re-evaluate as it resolves.
