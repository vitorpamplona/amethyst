/**
 * Dials the relays a freshly loaded [Account] is about to ask, before anything asks them.
 *
 * An account's first REQs (its own lists, then the home feed) come from subscriptions the screens
 * register once they compose, and a relay only dials once a REQ wants it. On a cold start the
 * first composition of the logged-in shell takes longer than a TLS handshake, so dialing at login
 * overlaps the two: by the time the REQs arrive, the sockets are open.
 *
 * Holds the connections with [INostrClient.keepConnected] for [holdMs], long enough for the
 * subscriptions to take over, then lets go: a relay nothing asks for by then closes as usual.
 * Dials the relays [pickAccountDataRelays] reads the account's own events from, and the outbox
 * relays of the follows as known now (on a cold cache, the hint and fallback relays the home feed
 * starts on). Blocked relays are left out.
