/**
 * Per-payment NIP-XX BOLT12 zap entry attached to a target Note.
 *
 * Unlike NIP-BC onchain zaps (which carry an async chain-verification state
 * machine), a BOLT12 zap is validated **synchronously** at consumption time —
 * the `lnp` payer proof is a self-contained cryptographic settlement proof — so
 * every entry stored here has already passed [com.vitorpamplona.quartz.nipXXBolt12Zaps.verify.Bolt12ZapValidator]
 * and its amount is counted directly, the same way a NIP-57 lightning zap
 * receipt's amount is.
 *
 * @property source The kind:9736 Bolt12ZapEvent note. `source.author` is the
 *                  payer shown in the reactions gallery and notifications card
 *                  (the `P` tag; an anonymous zap uses an ephemeral key).
 * @property amountMillisats The validated amount in **millisatoshis** (the
 *                  `amount` tag, checked against the proof's `invoice_amount`).
 * @property cryptoVerified True when the payer proof's signatures were fully
 *                  verified. False when the zap is structurally valid and bound
 *                  to its intent but the proof is compressed and its signatures
 *                  can't yet be checked (pending the lightning/bolts#1346 merkle
 *                  reconstruction). The UI SHOULD label the latter as unverified.
