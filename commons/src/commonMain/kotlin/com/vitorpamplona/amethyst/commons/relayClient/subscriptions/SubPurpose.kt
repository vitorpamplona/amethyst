/**
 * Why a subscription exists — the client-side answer to "what is this relay doing for me?".
 *
 * Attached to an [ExplainedFilter] and **never sent to a relay**. It exists so the app can account
 * for its own connections: the always-on notification reports a bare "connected to N relays", which
 * is emergent rather than curated — nothing today can tell you whether those N are carrying your DMs
 * or re-dialling a stale outbox hint.
 *
 * ## Two levels on purpose
 *
 * The fine value names the actual job; [group] rolls it up. A relay screen or a bug report wants the
 * fine value ("hashtag feed" vs "thread you are reading"); a notification a user glances at wants the
 * group. Adding a fine value is cheap because the UI can keep rendering groups.
 *
 * ## Lifetime is the other axis
 *
 * [runsInBackground] marks the purposes *allowed* to outlive the foreground — the ones the always-on
 * notification is actually about. Read it as a ceiling, not a promise: a background-capable purpose
 * with nothing to fetch is simply absent, so absence proves nothing. The direction that does hold is
 * the other one — **a purpose with `runsInBackground = false` appearing while backgrounded is a leak**,
 * and that is now assertable.
 *
 * Measured on device (cold start, then HOME): foreground carried 13 purposes; backgrounded carried 9,
 * every one of them `runsInBackground = true`. `HOME_FEED` (337 relays) and `ENGAGEMENT` (20) — the only
 * two `false` entries in flight — were both gone, while the transient account loaders
 * ([RELAY_LISTS], [FOLLOW_LISTS]) were idle rather than torn down.
