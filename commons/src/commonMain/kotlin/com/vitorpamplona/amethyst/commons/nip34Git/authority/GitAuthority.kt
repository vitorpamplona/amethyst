/**
 * Who may change an issue's, patch's or PR's state, from the repository announcements in the
 * cache. Anyone can publish a status, a PR update, a label or a cover note for any item; only the
 * item's author and the repository's confirmed members ([GitRepositoryMembership]) change what
 * the item shows. Everything else is at most a proposal.
 *
 * An event counts by the roles when it was signed ([isMemberAt], [isMaintainerAt]): a merge by
 * someone who became a maintainer later is still a proposal, as gitworkshop judges it. Who may
 * act now ([memberActorsOf]) uses today's membership. While a repository's announcement has not
 * loaded, its coordinate's own pubkey stands in for its members, so the owner's statuses show
