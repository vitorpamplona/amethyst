 * is on screen.
 *
 * Why hoisted: the marker for a limit lives in exactly one gap (between the two rows straddling its
 * reached cursor). Placing the sentinel *inside* that row made its effect's identity ride the hosting
 * row — so any feed reorder (a live message, or a slow relay dribbling a history page) moved the gap to a
 * different row, tore the effect down and recreated it, and re-fired `advance()` on a static screen.
 * That re-armed stalled/auth relays into a silence-watchdog storm and could walk a delivering relay
 * back a window with no scroll. Hoisting the effect and driving it off **viewport visibility** instead
 * of composition presence removes that coupling.
 *
 * Fires `advance()` when (and only when) the marker's gap is among the currently visible rows AND either
 * it just scrolled into view OR its reached cursor moved (a page landed — keep paging while visible).
 * A reorder that keeps the marker on the same side of the fold changes neither, so it no longer re-fires.
 * A done relay drives nothing.
 *
 * @param createdAtAt createdAt of the list item at an index (null past the ends / for non-message rows),
 *   so the visible-gap test mirrors [RelayReachMarkers]'s placement against only the on-screen rows.

 * same depth (e.g. all nine clustered at the oldest-end floor) so the line can't grow into an unreadable
 * comma list. In the rare mixed line (an active frontier sharing the oldest-end gap with done relays) the
 * caption is "Loading:", so the done chip is suffixed "(fully loaded)" to keep its meaning clear. Either
 * way the whole marker is tappable for the full per-relay breakdown. Reads e.g. "Loading: ↓ nostr.wine"
