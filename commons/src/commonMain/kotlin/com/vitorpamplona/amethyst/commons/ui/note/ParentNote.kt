/**
 * The note to render as the "replying to" card above [note], or null when there is no parent to
 * show. Prefers the parent the event itself names, falling back to the last resolved reply target.
 *
 * NIP-72 communities are deliberately never returned. A community is not a note a post replies
 * to in any renderable sense: it is already named in the post's header and gets its own context
 * card. Two shapes have to be caught for that to hold:
 *
 *  - the parent resolves to the community's [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.model.AddressableNote];
 *  - the post is a top-level community post whose bridged tags point at the definition event by
 *    *id* (mostr does this), which resolves to a plain [Note] that can never load, because
 *    addressable events are cached by address and not by id.
 *
 * Both used to slip through a `note.event?.kind != CommunityDefinitionEvent.KIND` test, because an
 * uncached note has a null event and `null != 34550`. The result was an empty card where the
 * parent context belongs.
