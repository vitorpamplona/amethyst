/**
 * Resolves a recipient's NIP-17 inbox relays (kind:10050) for DM delivery.
 *
 * Three-layer lookup, in order:
 *
 * 1. **LocalCache hit** — the caller has already seen the user's kind:10050
 *    via the normal feed subscription pipeline. Cheapest; no I/O.
 * 2. **In-memory LRU cache** — a prior resolve() succeeded for this pubkey
 *    within the TTL. Avoids re-querying indexers when the user opens a
 *    conversation list and clicks several recipients in sequence.
 * 3. **Indexer fan-out** — query a curated set of indexer relays for the
 *    user's kind:10050 via [RecipientRelayFetcher]. The client passed in
 *    here MUST be an **unauthenticated** instance (no [RelayAuthenticator]
 *    attached) — otherwise an indexer's AUTH challenge would extract an
 *    identity-key signature from the user, turning the metadata leak
 *    "indexer learns who we want to DM" into "indexer learns user U wants
 *    to DM pubkey X".
 *
 * Filters to **kind:10050 only**. Per NIP-17 §Publishing, gift wraps MUST
 * land on relays in the recipient's kind:10050; this resolver never
 * substitutes the NIP-65 read marker as a fallback, because doing so leaks
 * DMs to relays the recipient did not explicitly designate for DMs.
 *
 * Empty result is the canonical "we don't know where to send" signal — the
 * caller should refuse to publish rather than fall back to its own relays
 * (see [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.desktop.model.DesktopIAccount.resolveDmInboxRelaysStrict]).
 *
 * @property unauthenticatedClient NostrClient WITHOUT a RelayAuthenticator
 *   attached. Use a dedicated instance — do NOT pass the app's primary
 *   client.
 * @property indexerRelays Curated indexer set. Typically
 *   [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.defaults.DefaultDmIndexerRelays].
 * @property localLookup Callback the resolver invokes first to check the
 *   LocalCache — returns the user's current kind:10050 list or null if
 *   unknown. Allows commons/headless callers to plug in a CLI-safe lookup.
 * @property cacheTtlMs LRU cache TTL. 1h matches the brainstorm's open
 *   question; configurable here for tests.
 * @property cacheSize LRU bound. 100 entries × ~200 bytes each is trivial
 *   memory; matches typical active-conversation count for power users.
