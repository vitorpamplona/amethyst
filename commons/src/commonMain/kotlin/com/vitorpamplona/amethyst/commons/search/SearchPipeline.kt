/**
 * A search, end to end, in one place: what was typed becomes a query, the query becomes filters,
 * what comes back is narrowed, and what survives is ordered.
 *
 * ```
 *   text ──► parse ──► filters ──► (ask relays / ask the cache) ──► keep ──► rank
 * ```
 *
 * Every piece here already existed and was already tested. What did not exist was the *sequence*,
 * and that is the whole reason for this object: each front end assembled the steps by hand, and
 * each of them forgot a different one. Android never called [keep], so `-term` and the pseudo-kinds
 * silently did nothing; it never used [rank]'s scorer, so Relevance sorted by date; it dropped the
 * query's kinds on the way to [filters], so a `kind:` chip narrowed nothing. Desktop had all three
 * and lacked others. None of those were visible as a missing call, because there was nothing they
 * were missing *from*.
 *
 * So the steps are here, in order, and a caller holding results calls [narrowAndOrder]. Reaching
 * for an individual step is still allowed — a relay subscription needs [filters] and nothing else
 * — but a caller collecting results and skipping [keep] is now a visible mistake rather than an
 * absence.
 *
 * ## Generic over the item
 *
 * Android holds `Note` (a mutable box around an event, with a zap total attached); desktop holds a
 * raw `Event`. Neither type belongs in the other's world, so [keep] and [rank] take accessors
 * instead: what event does this item carry, and what is it worth. That is the entire difference
 * between the two front ends, and it is two lambdas wide.
 *
 * CLI-safe: no Compose, no coroutines, no state. Pure functions over data.

     * ranks on noise. A query that is all chips has nothing to be more or less relevant to, and
     * falls back to newest.
     *
     * [zapTotal] answers POPULAR, as a plain [Double] rather than the `BigDecimal` a `Note`
     * carries: that type is `expect`-declared in quartz with no `Comparable`, and its JVM actual
     * is `java.math.BigDecimal`, so a comparator over it cannot be written in common code. A
     * double holds every sat total exactly up to 2^53, which is past any zap that will exist.
     *
     * A front end holding raw events has no zap totals and leaves it at zero, which collapses
     * POPULAR into newest for that caller — the only honest answer a raw `Event` can give.
     *
     * Sort keys are snapshotted per item before comparing. A `Note` is a mutable box: a newer
     * addressable event arriving from a relay mid-sort changes `createdAt` under the comparator,
     * and TimSort answers that with "Comparison method violates its general contract!".
