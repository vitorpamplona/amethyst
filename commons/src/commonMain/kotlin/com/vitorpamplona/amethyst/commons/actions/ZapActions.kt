/**
 * NIP-57 zap-request building + LN address extraction.
 *
 * Returns a signed [LnZapRequestEvent] (kind:9734) — the artifact a caller
 * hands to a LNURL-pay callback to receive a BOLT11 invoice.
 *
 * **Caller responsibilities** that the Amethyst Android flow handles but
 * these builders do not:
 *
 *  * **Use [buildEventZapRequestsForSplits] for events.** A naive call to
 *    [buildEventZapRequest] on a note carrying NIP-57 zap-split tags, NIP-53
 *    live-activity host tags, or NIP-89 app metadata silently misroutes
 *    funds to a single recipient. The splits variant is what the
 *    foreground UI uses and what amy `zap event` calls.
 *  * **Lightning round-trip.** LNURL endpoint fetch, BOLT11 invoice
 *    retrieval, and optional NIP-47 NWC payment all live outside these
 *    builders. `LightningAddressResolver` (in commons/jvmAndroid) covers
 *    the LNURL + invoice steps.
 *  * **Receipt verification.** When the kind:9735 receipt arrives, validate
 *    it against the LNURL provider's `nostrPubkey` (NIP-57 Appendix F) —
 *    primed via `LnurlEndpointCache` on Android.
 *  * **Onchain zaps** (NIP-BC) are a separate flow — see `OnchainZapSender`
 *    in commons. These builders only cover Lightning.
 *
 * Pattern matches [FollowActions] and [SearchActions]: shared, pure logic
 * usable from amy CLI, the Android App Functions adapter for Gemini, and
 * any other non-UI consumer.
