/**
 * Picks the `imeta` entry a NIP-71 event's player should load.
 *
 * An HLS video event carries a whole ladder in its tags: one imeta for the **master playlist**
 * (which enumerates every rendition, so the player can adapt) plus one per **rendition** (a media
 * playlist locked to a single resolution). Rendering `imetaTags()[0]` blindly — what every call
 * site used to do — only works because Amethyst's own publisher happens to emit the master first
 * (see `HlsVideoEventBuilder`). Any client that orders the tags differently pins us to one rung:
 * no adaptive bitrate, and no quality menu either, because a media playlist exposes a single
 * video track and `VideoQualityButton` hides itself below two.
 *
 * The choice, in order:
 * 1. Drop imetas that can't be the video: audio-only tracks (NIP-71 PR #2255 splits audio out so
 *    clients can switch resolution without interrupting sound) and explicit image posters.
 *    If that leaves nothing, fall back to the first imeta — a NIP-71 event asserts its own type,
 *    and the renderers already handle an image-shaped one.
 * 2. Prefer HLS over a progressive file when both are offered: only HLS can adapt.
 * 3. Among the HLS entries, take the largest declared `dim`, earliest tag wins a tie. A master
 *    advertises the top of its own ladder, so it ties for the maximum and wins by position under
 *    the master-first convention. When a publisher omits the master entirely this picks the top
 *    rendition rather than the bottom one, which is the same complaint answered a weaker way.
 * 4. Only when **no** HLS entry declares a `dim` does tag order decide. A missing `dim` is not a
 *    reliable master signal on its own: a ladder-spanning manifest has no single resolution to
 *    declare, but a sloppily-published *rendition* can equally omit one, and preferring the
 *    dim-less entry outright would then pin us to a single low rung — the exact bug this function
 *    exists to fix. Deferring to the largest declared `dim` fails the other way instead: worst
 *    case we select the top rendition and lose adaptation, never the bottom one.
 *
 * Presentation metadata is ladder-wide — every rung shares the poster, the blurhash and the
 * aspect ratio — so anything missing from the chosen entry is filled in from its siblings. That
 * keeps the placeholder and the layout intact when the master turns out to be the bare one.
