/**
 * One account's cordn rooms, across every coordinator it talks to.
 *
 * ## Keyed by (coordinator, gid), never by gid alone
 *
 * A `gid` is unique only within one coordinator (`spec/00.md` §4) — two of them
 * can both serve `gid = "abc"` as unrelated groups with different members and
 * different ratchet trees. A map keyed by `gid` would let one answer for the
 * other, and from the user's side that reads as a room whose history changes
 * depending on which coordinator last synced. The same rule keys
 * `CordnCoordinatorRegistry` and the on-disk stores; this is the third place
 * it shows up, and it is the same rule each time.
