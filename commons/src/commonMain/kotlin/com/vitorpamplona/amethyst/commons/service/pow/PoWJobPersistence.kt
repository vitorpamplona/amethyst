/**
 * Durable record of a template mining job so a post survives process death:
 * everything needed to re-mine and re-send with no lambda captured — the
 * unsigned template plus a flat replay descriptor the platform layer turns
 * back into the right sign+broadcast call.
 *
 * Replay types are interpreted by the platform restorer (see the Android
 * `PowJobRestorer`): [REPLAY_BROADCAST] signs and broadcasts to the computed
 * outbox relays, [REPLAY_RELAYS] publishes to [relayUrls], [REPLAY_SCHEDULE]
 * signs and parks the event in the scheduled-post store for [publishAtSec].
