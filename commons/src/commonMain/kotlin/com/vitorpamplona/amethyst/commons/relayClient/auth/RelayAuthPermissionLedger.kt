/**

 * Precedence (see [RelayAuthResolver]): blocked-relay list → per-relay override → this session's
 * in-memory grants ([sessionGrants]) → global [globalPolicy] → prompt-if-attributable-else-deny.
 * Under [RelayAuthPolicy.CUSTOM] the
 * [customToggles] gate each category, using [isFollowed] to split the counterparties carried in the
 * [RelayAuthContext] into followed vs. stranger.
 *
 * Venues come in two shapes and both count as "a room I joined" for the
 * [RelayAuthCustomToggles.myRelaysAndVenues] toggle: [isTrustedVenue] recognizes a venue *id* named
 * by a purpose (a NIP-28 chat, a NIP-72 community, a NIP-53 stream, a NIP-29 group id, a Concord
 * community id), while [isVenueHostRelay] recognizes the relay that *hosts* one — the only signal
 * available for a room whose traffic never names it in a way the deriver can see, or whose challenge
 * arrives before its subscription does. [isTrustedVenue] is asked about the (relay, venue) pair
 * rather than the id alone because a NIP-29 group id means nothing without its host relay.
