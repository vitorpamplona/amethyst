/**
 * Draws a Simple Nostr Object into a pixel buffer, on the CPU.
 *
 * Software rather than `Canvas.drawVertices`, which is common Compose API and
 * would give interpolated triangles for free, because that call is only
 * hardware-accelerated from API 29 and Amethyst's `minSdk` is 26 — on Android 8
 * and 9 it silently draws nothing. Doing it here also buys a real depth buffer,
 * which a painter's-algorithm fallback does not have and which lattice geometry
 * needs the moment two objects are authored to share an edge, and it makes the
 * whole renderer testable headless, with no device and no screenshot harness.
 *
 * The shading is what DECK-0003 §4 decides, so that the same object does not
 * look like two objects:
 * - **Unlit.** A face takes its colour by interpolating its three vertices and
 *   no light in the scene changes it. This is `KHR_materials_unlit` with a
 *   `COLOR_0` attribute, which is the one-sentence bridge to anyone in glTF.
 * - **Two-sided.** A face has no front and no back: winding order carries no
 *   meaning and nothing is culled by it.
 * - **A face that carries its own colour is filled with it flatly**, and there
 *   is nothing to interpolate or average: the seam between two such faces is
 *   exact, which is the whole purpose of `facecolors`.
 * - **No invented geometry.** No subdivision, no smoothing that moves a vertex,
 *   no hole filling, and no synthesised smooth normals. The lattice is exact and
 *   a renderer that moves a vertex has broken the one guarantee it makes.
 *
 * §4 also permits a client to light an object instead, which is what the
 * `lighting` argument does; see [SnoLighting] for what that changes and why it
 * is offered only where a reader is inspecting one object rather than
 * scrolling past many.
 *
 * Positions arrive as exact integers and are converted to floats here, at the
 * boundary, and nowhere earlier (§1.2).
