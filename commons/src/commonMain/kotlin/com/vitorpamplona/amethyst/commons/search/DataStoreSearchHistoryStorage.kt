/**
 * [SearchHistoryStorage] on a DataStore of its own — `search_history` under the

 *
 * Takes the store rather than a directory: the search screen is rebuilt per
 * seeded query, and DataStore refuses a second live instance on a path that
 * already has one, so who owns the instance matters. Handing it in means the
 * caller's store holder is the single registry rather than this class keeping a
 * private one of its own.
