/**
 * Decides the ONE proxy route shared by every WebView in the sandbox process.
 *
 * Android's WebView proxy override is process-global, yet Tor is chosen per surface (per site): a
 * browser tab, an nSite, a full-screen page. When each surface set or cleared the override for itself,
 * the last one to do so won for everyone — opening an open-web page silently moved an already-open Tor
 * page onto the open web, with no reload and nothing on screen to say so.
 *
 * So every live surface files a claim, and the route is derived from all of them: **Tor always wins.**
 * While ANY claim wants Tor, the whole process goes through Tor (the most recent Tor claim's port — a Tor
 * restart can move it), open-web surfaces included; with no Tor claim at all there is no proxy.
 *
 * There are deliberately no per-host exemptions. Exempting an open-web page's host would let a Tor page
 * reach that host directly — and an attacker who got one page onto the open web (a site opened before Tor
 * was up, say) could then have a Tor page load `https://x.attacker.com/<id>` and tie the user's real IP to
 * the Tor session. The cost is that an open-web page goes through Tor while another open page needs it;
 * surfaces show why (see [Route.usesTor]).
 *
 * Not thread-safe: the caller serializes access (the sandbox touches it only on its main thread).
