/**
 * A lifecycle-aware version of [KeyDataSourceSubscription] that subscribes
 * when the lifecycle reaches STARTED and unsubscribes 30 seconds after it
 * reaches STOPPED. If the lifecycle returns to STARTED before the grace
 * period elapses, the pending unsubscribe is cancelled and the subscription
 * keeps running uninterrupted.
 *
 * The grace window absorbs short app switches (copy a snippet from another
 * app, dismiss a notification, glance at recents) without tearing down and
 * rebuilding the relay REQ — which would otherwise lose EOSE state and
 * trigger a refetch on return.
 *
 * Lifecycle transitions are observed with a main-thread [LifecycleEventObserver],
 * which fires synchronously during `onStop`/`onStart`. Detecting the transition
 * via a background-dispatched flow instead delivered `ON_STOP` up to ~60s late on
 * a backgrounded device (the collector only resumed on the next relay keep-alive
 * tick), leaving feeds connected long after the app was paused. Only the grace
 * *delay* runs on a [Dispatchers.Default] scope, so it isn't gated by the UI
 * frame clock (which stops ticking while backgrounded); returning to STARTED
 * cancels the pending unsubscribe before it fires.
 *
 * Use this for heavy feed subscriptions (home, video, discovery, chatroom list)
 * that should NOT run when the app is truly in the background. When an
 * always-on notification service keeps the relay client connected, these
 * subscriptions would otherwise leak bandwidth on feeds nobody is viewing.
 *
 * Lightweight subscriptions that should always run (account metadata, notifications,
 * gift wraps) should continue using the regular [KeyDataSourceSubscription].
