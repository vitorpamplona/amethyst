 * Everything the resolver needs to decide an auth challenge, gathered by the host (which owns
 * the blocked-relay list, the user's relay lists, and the follow graph). Kept as plain values
 * so the decision itself is pure and unit-testable without any account/relay wiring.
 *
 * @param storedOverride an explicit per-relay decision the user set previously, or null.
 * @param hasSessionGrant the user already answered "log in" for this relay during this run of the
 *   app, without asking to remember it permanently. Held in memory only, so it dies with the process.
 * @param isBlocked the relay is on the user's blocked-relay list (kind 10006).
 * @param policy the top-level [RelayAuthPolicy].
 * @param toggles the [RelayAuthCustomToggles] applied when [policy] is [RelayAuthPolicy.CUSTOM].
 * @param isInMyRelayList the relay is in the user's own relay list.
 * @param servesTrustedVenue this relay hosts a venue the user has joined, subscribed to, or
 *   favorited — a public chat, a NIP-72 community, a live stream, a NIP-29 relay group, or a Concord
 *   community. True either because a purpose names one of those venues or because the relay itself is
 *   a joined room's host (a group/community relay serves nothing else).
 * @param servesFollowedReadCounterparty a followed user's outbox is served here (reading them).
 * @param servesFollowedWriteCounterparty a followed user's inbox is served here (messaging them).
 * @param servesStrangerWriteCounterparty a non-followed user's inbox is served here (messaging them).
 * @param hasAttributablePurpose we know *why* this relay wants auth (so a prompt can explain it).
 *   When false, an unresolved challenge is denied silently rather than prompting.
 * @param isFirstParty this account has a reason of its *own* to be on this relay — it is publishing
 *   there, a subscription there reads its own inbox/outbox, or the relay is in its own relay list.
 *   False means the only reason we are here belongs to somebody else (another logged-in account's
 *   traffic, or a followed author whose outbox happens to live here). Gates the *automatic* grants
 *   only: a non-first-party challenge is never auto-allowed, but it still reaches the user as a
 *   prompt rather than a silent denial.

/**
 * Pure NIP-42 auth decision. Precedence, highest first:
 *
 * 1. Blocked-relay list → [RelayAuthVerdict.DENY] (never reveal identity to a blocked relay).
 * 2. Explicit per-relay override → honor it.
 * 3. [RelayAuthInputs.hasSessionGrant] → [RelayAuthVerdict.ALLOW]. Ranked *below* the stored override
 *    so a later "never allow" — the only way a DENY can be written for a relay already granted this
 *    session — takes effect immediately instead of losing to the in-memory grant.
 * 4. Top-level [RelayAuthPolicy]:
 *    - [RelayAuthPolicy.NEVER] → DENY
 *    - [RelayAuthPolicy.ALWAYS] → ALLOW
 *    - [RelayAuthPolicy.CUSTOM] → ALLOW if any *enabled* [RelayAuthCustomToggles] category matches
 *      this relay (own relays/venues, reading follows, messaging follows, messaging strangers);
 *      else fall through
 * 5. Fall-through → [RelayAuthVerdict.ASK] when the purpose is known, otherwise DENY.
 *
 * The [RelayAuthPolicy.CUSTOM] grant additionally requires [RelayAuthInputs.isFirstParty]: under
 * "decide per relay" an account never reveals its identity *without being asked* on a relay it has no
 * reason of its own to be on, which is what keeps a bystander account off a relay only another account
 * uses. It deliberately does not suppress the question — a non-first-party challenge we can explain
 * falls through to ASK, so the user decides rather than getting a silent denial they never see.
 *
 * [RelayAuthPolicy.ALWAYS] is NOT gated this way: it means what it says, every relay that asks. Users
 * who want the narrower "only the relays I actually use" behaviour choose CUSTOM.
