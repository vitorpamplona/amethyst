/**
 * One cordn group, as a screen sees it.
 *
 * ## Keyed by envelope id, never by cursor
 *
 * `spec/02.md` §7 is explicit that the envelope id is the message identity and
 * the cursor is a delivery primitive. They are easy to confuse because both are
 * unique within a group and both arrive together, and confusing them is not a
 * cosmetic bug: a cursor is coordinator-local, so the same message re-delivered
 * after a re-sync carries a different one. Keying on it would duplicate every
 * message the client ever re-fetches, and dedupe would silently stop working
 * exactly when a group is recovering.
 *
 * ## Ordered by the cursor, not by the sender's clock
 *
 * `created_at` is a claim the sender makes about their own device. Sorting on
 * it is the classic Nostr failure: one wrong clock scatters that member's
 * messages through the room, and a sender who wants to can pin a message to
 * the top of the history permanently by backdating it. The cursor has neither
 * problem — the coordinator assigns it, so it is the one order every member
 * already agrees on, and no sender can choose their own.
 *
 * This does trust the coordinator to order the stream, which it is trusted for
 * anyway: `spec/00.md` §4 makes it the sole authority for a group's stream. It
 * is **not** trusted for content, and is not being trusted for any more here —
 * MLS authenticates what a message says and who sent it, the coordinator says
 * only when it arrived. `created_at` is still shown; it is just not what the
 * list is built from.
 *
 * ## Not a Marmot room with the names changed
 *
 * `MarmotGroupChatroom` holds `Note`s, carries Marmot's GroupContext state
 * (lifecycle, outbound gates, legacy-profile flags, encrypted-media policy) and
 * is fed from `LocalCache`. None of that exists here: cordn has no lifecycle
 * extension, no outbound gate, no profile split, and its messages arrive as
 * envelopes from a coordinator rather than events from a relay. The two look
 * alike only in that both are group chats — see §3.1 of
 * `amethyst/plans/2026-09-19-cordn-ui.md`, which the isolation guards enforce.
