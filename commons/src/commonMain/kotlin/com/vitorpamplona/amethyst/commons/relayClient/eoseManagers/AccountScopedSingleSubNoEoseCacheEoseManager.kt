/**
 * Amethyst variant of [SingleSubNoEoseCacheEoseManager] that restores single-account
 * attribution for [AccountScopedQuery] keys.
 *
 * The commons base is account-agnostic (attribution defaults to null) so it can live in
 * commonMain. Query states that carry an [Account] (home feed, channels, notifications, …)
 * subclass this so their single-account REQs still show up attributed in "Active Relay
 * Subscriptions".
 *
 * Keyed on [AccountScopedQuery] rather than a concrete query-state type: the home feed uses
 * HomeQueryState, notifications use AccountQueryState, and checking one concrete class filed the
 * other under "not attributed" despite both being built from a single account's data.
