/**
 * The set of `block/buzz` workspaces the user has **joined** — one relay (tenant) each.
 *
 * Distinct from [BuzzRelayDialect], which merely marks relays *observed* to speak the Buzz
 * dialect: a workspace here is one the user actively joined (redeemed an invite for), so the
 * app must connect + NIP-42-authenticate + run the member-channel discovery against it, even
 * on a cold start before any Buzz event has arrived to trigger dialect detection. Buzz
 * membership is granted server-side by the HTTP invite claim — there is no NIP-51/kind-10009
 * join event to key off — so this joined set is the client's own bookkeeping of which relays
 * to sync as workspaces.
 *
 * Persisted across launches by the platform (`BuzzWorkspacePreferences` on Android mirrors it
 * to a device-global store and restores it at startup). Like [BuzzRelayDialect] it is a
 * process-wide singleton; joining also marks the relay as a Buzz dialect.
