package com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.napplet

/**
 * The napplet / website requests that ACT for the user or use their key — publish, pay, upload, notify,
 * open a file picker or write a file the user picked, and a website's NIP-07 sign / encrypt / decrypt — as opposed to reading.
 * A host holds these while the user isn't looking at the surface (it's parked off-screen, or the app is in
 * the background): pausing the WebView stops animations and media but not JavaScript, so without this an
 * "allow always" napplet or site could keep publishing, paying, signing or decrypting while the user looks
 * elsewhere. Reads (`getPublicKey`, relay queries, …) keep flowing, so a preloaded surface still fills in.
 *
 * NAP-INC (`inc.*`) is not held: it only passes data between the user's own napplets, signs nothing and
 * leaves the app nowhere, and whatever a receiving napplet does with it is held on that napplet's own
 * surface. Holding some `inc.*` messages and not others would also reorder them (an emit held, the
 * channel close after it sent at once), and a napplet in the background could never answer a peer.
