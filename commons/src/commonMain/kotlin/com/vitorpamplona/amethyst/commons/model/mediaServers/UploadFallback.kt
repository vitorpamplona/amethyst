 * The Blossom servers an upload tries, in order: the one the user picked, then the rest
 * of the list the picker offered them (their kind-10063 servers, or the defaults when
 * they have none), top down.
 *
 * Servers differ in what they accept, and nothing tells the user in advance: primal,
 * azzamo and blossom.band answer an encrypted (application/octet-stream) blob with
 * 415, some demand payment, some are simply down. With a single target, picking the
 * wrong one meant a failed upload and a retry by hand; the settings screen already told
 * users uploads "try each server from the top down".
 *
 * Blossom only: a NIP-96 or NIP-95 upload keeps its single target, because falling back
 * from one would change the kind of event the upload produces.
