/**
 * Debug-build tripwire: warns when a REQ or COUNT reaches the pool with a filter that never said
 * why it exists.
 *
 * Such a filter keeps its relays connected with nothing to show for it — the always-on notification
 * counts the relay, but no line of its breakdown names it. Tagging is a convention, and a new
 * `fetchAll(Filter(...))` slips past review easily, so this names the offender the first time it
 * runs instead of leaving it to surface as an unexplained relay count on someone's phone.
 *
 * Each producer is reported once, keyed by its subscription-id prefix and kinds, so an assembler
 * that re-sends its REQ every few seconds does not flood the log. Never wired into release builds.
