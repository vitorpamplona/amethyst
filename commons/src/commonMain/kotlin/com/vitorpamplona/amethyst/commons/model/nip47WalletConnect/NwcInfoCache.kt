/**
 * Per-account cache of NWC wallets' kind 13194 info events, keyed by wallet
 * service pubkey. One fetch backs every capability question we ask about a
 * wallet — the advertised encryption schemes (NIP-44 vs NIP-04 negotiation), the
 * supported RPC methods, and whether it emits notifications.
 *
 * Entries expire after [ttlSeconds] (default 2 days) so a wallet that later
 * changes its advertised capabilities is eventually re-checked. Four entry
 * points, in increasing order of how much they will wait:
 *
 *  - [current] returns whatever is cached (possibly stale, possibly null) with no
 *    side effect and never blocks — for callers that can act on "don't know".
 *  - [refreshIfStale] triggers a background fetch when the entry is missing or
 *    expired, and returns immediately — call it right before using a wallet so a
 *    stale entry self-heals without holding up the transaction.
 *  - [currentOrFetch] waits only when nothing at all is cached, and returns a
 *    stale entry as-is — for callers where "don't know" and "no" are different
 *    answers, such as NIP-44 negotiation.
 *  - [getFresh] waits whenever the entry is missing *or* expired, for a caller
 *    that must not act on a stale answer. No production caller needs that today.
 *
 * Every fetching path funnels through one request per wallet, so the startup
 * warm-up, a payment waiting on a cold cache and the notification watcher join
 * the same call rather than racing each other.
 *
 * A completed fetch — including a definitive "wallet published no info event"
 * (null) — is cached with a timestamp. A *failed* fetch (network error/timeout)
 * is never cached, so a transient error retries on the next use instead of
 * pinning the wallet to the fallback for the whole TTL window.
