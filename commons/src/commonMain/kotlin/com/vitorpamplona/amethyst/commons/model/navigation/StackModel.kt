/**
 * The stack layout (and the deck's main screen): [stack] is what is on screen, bottom to top. It is
 * never empty and normally starts at [Route.Home]. [savedTabs] holds the root entry of every
 * bottom-bar tab the user left: a tab survives being left — its ViewModels and scroll position —
 * because its entry stays here, and so stays in the list whose state Navigation 3 keeps alive.
 * Nothing *above* a tab root is ever saved: switching tabs drops it first, so returning to a tab
 * always lands on the tab itself.
