/**
 * A NIP-85 trust provider whose sign-up Amethyst knows how to run.
 *
 * NIP-85 says how a provider publishes scores and how a user points to it (kind 10040), but not
 * how a user becomes a provider's customer or learns the per-user keys it signs with. Each
 * provider has its own API for that, so each one is an implementation of this interface.
 *
 * The provider decides the kind 10040 rows ([TrustProviderRegistration.rows]): it knows which
 * key serves which tag. The user can also sign up on the provider's own site ([setupUrl]),
 * which publishes the list itself. Writing the rows by hand is the fallback for when that goes
 * wrong, or for a provider without either.
