 * KMP-friendly reentrant lock. JVM/Android map to `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock`;
 * iOS will map to `NSLock` (or a thin wrapper around it) when the target is added.
 *
 * Use [withLock] in preference to manual lock/unlock — it guarantees release on
 * exception. The class is reentrant on every platform, so a thread that already
 * holds the lock can re-enter without deadlocking.
