     * guess is the answer, and that covers every ordinary day plus the two interesting ones —
     * a day whose clocks move at 2am (the change is after midnight, so both probes sit on the
     * same side of it) and a day whose midnight hour is *repeated*, where the earlier of the two
     * midnights is the one that converges, matching `java.time`.
     *
     * They disagree only when local midnight does not exist at all: a zone that springs forward
     * *at* midnight (Chile, Cuba, Iran have all done this) skips straight from 23:59:59 to 01:00,
     * and no instant maps to 00:00. There the later probe is the first instant of the day that
     * does exist, which is what a `since:` bound wants.
