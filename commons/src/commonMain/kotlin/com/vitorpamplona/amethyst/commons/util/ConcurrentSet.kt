/**
 * KMP-friendly thread-safe set of non-null elements.
 *
 * On JVM/Android this is backed by `ConcurrentHashMap.newKeySet()`, so
 * concurrent [add] / [contains] / [remove] from many threads do NOT all
 * serialize on one monitor — writes are lock-striped and reads are lock-free.
 * That is the difference from wrapping a plain set in a single [KmpLock], where
 * every operation from every thread contends the same lock.
 *
 * iOS has no lock-free set in the standard library, so its actual guards a plain
 * set with a reentrant lock — same behaviour as before, no regression. The
 * win is on the JVM/Android app, which is where the high-throughput event
 * paths run.
 *
 * Use this only when the access pattern is genuinely multi-threaded and hot
 * (e.g. per-event dedup fed by multiple relay callback threads). A set touched
 * only from one thread does not need it.
