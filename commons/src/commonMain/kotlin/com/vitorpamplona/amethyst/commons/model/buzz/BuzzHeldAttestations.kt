/**
 * The NIP-OA [OwnerAttestation] this account holds — an owner-signed authorization letting its key
 * publish in the owner's Buzz workspace without being enrolled as a relay member.
 *
 * The counterpart of issuance ([OwnerAttestation] is signed by an owner and handed to an agent
 * operator out-of-band): when this account authenticates (NIP-42) to a Buzz-dialect relay, the auth
 * coordinator attaches [authTag] to the AUTH event, and the relay grants virtual membership while
 * the owner stays a member.
 *
 * **One instance per account** (`Account.buzzAttestation`), holding at most one attestation — the
 * one issued to [agentPubKey]. It was a process-wide `Map<agentPubKey, OwnerAttestation>`, but every
 * caller only ever read or wrote the entry for the account doing the AUTH, so the map was a
 * single-entry map with a lookup that could not miss. Owning the agent key here also lets [put]
 * enforce the verification its callers used to be told to perform, which is the property that
 * matters: the store never carries a credential the relay would reject.
