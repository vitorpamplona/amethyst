/**
 * §7.7's hint-and-sweep, priced for a reader with a battery.
 *
 * The protocol half is [RegionSweep]; this is the budget around it, and the
 * budget is the entire product decision. A hint is a stranger's declaration of
 * how hard they want the search to be, so everything here is arranged so the
 * reader finds out the price before paying it:
 *
 * 1. [quote] reads the two tags and costs nothing. A box past [MAX_GAP_BITS] or
 *    a bag deeper than [MAX_BAG_HEIGHT] is out of reach and never becomes a
 *    button.
 * 2. [sweep] times the first candidate on the device it is actually running on
 *    before committing to the rest, and stops if that measurement says the box
 *    is past [BUDGET_MILLIS]. The plan for this feature said to measure the
 *    Android cost before quoting a number in the UI; measuring it at the moment
 *    of the tap is the same answer without a constant that goes stale on the
 *    next handset.
 * 3. The sweep is a cold [Flow] over a cold [Sequence], so a cancelled
 *    collection stops paying immediately.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to a relay, because the bag is already in hand: this is
 * §7.7's search applied to one event someone put in front of you, not a crawl.
 * And nothing starts on its own — [sweep] runs when it is collected.
