/**
 * NIP-17 direct-message verbs — relay resolution policy + gift-wrap builders.
 *
 * Like [FollowActions] / [SearchActions] / [ZapActions], this is pure logic
 * usable from amy CLI, the Android App Functions adapter for Gemini, and any
 * other non-UI consumer. The send builders return signed gift wraps but do
 * NOT publish; the read side (decrypting incoming gift wraps) stays at the
 * caller because the `unwrapAndUnsealOrNull` extension in
 * `commons/.../relayClient/nip17Dm/` is already a one-liner.
 *
 * **Caller responsibilities** that this object leaves to the consumer:
 *
 *  * **Publish.** Each wrap goes to its own recipient's DM-relay set —
 *    resolve via [resolveDmRelays] and hand each wrap to your relay client.
 *  * **Recipient resolution.** Translate npub / NIP-05 / hex to [HexKey]
 *    before calling — the Android UI uses `User.pubkeyHex`, amy uses
 *    `Context.requireUserHex`, the Gemini adapter would resolve through
 *    its own NIP-05 path.
 *  * **File upload (kind:15).** [buildFileDmReference] assumes the file is
 *    already at a URL. For "upload-then-DM", use
 *    `commons/.../service/upload/UploadOrchestrator` (jvmAndroid only, has
 *    an OkHttp dep) before calling here.
 *  * **Receipt of incoming DMs.** The kind:1059 gift-wrap drain, NIP-44
 *    unseal, and decrypt-to-inner-event step is a 3-line caller-side loop
 *    over [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.relayClient.nip17Dm.unwrapAndUnsealOrNull]
 *    — too small to bother extracting.
