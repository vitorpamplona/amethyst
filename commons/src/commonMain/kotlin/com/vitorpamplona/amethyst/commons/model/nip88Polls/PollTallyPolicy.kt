/**
 * The rules a [PollResponsesCache] tally must apply, taken from the kind-1068 poll itself.
 *
 * A tally cannot be computed correctly from the responses alone: whether a response's second
 * `response` tag counts, whether an option code exists at all, and whether a vote arrived while
 * the poll was open are all questions only the poll event can answer. Responses routinely arrive
 * before the poll they reference, so the tally starts permissive (`policy == null`) and is
 * recomputed once [PollResponsesCache.updatePolicy] delivers this.
