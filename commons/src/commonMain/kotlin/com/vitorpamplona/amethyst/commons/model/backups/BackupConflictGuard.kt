 * and call [accept] from every backup update.

 * [isLocallySigned] tells versions this app produced from ones that came from relays; it
 * defaults to [LocallySignedEvents]. [onChange] runs whenever the set of open conflicts

 * the update that owns its slot: a conflict restored from storage has no retry closure until
 * its version arrives again, and keeping it must work regardless.
