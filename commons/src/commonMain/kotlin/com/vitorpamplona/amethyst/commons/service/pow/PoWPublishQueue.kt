 * FIFO with at most [maxConcurrent] concurrent miners so a burst of posts
 * queues up instead of spawning unbounded CPU work. Each job's nonce search
 * runs on [minerThreads] parallel workers (see PoWMiner.mine) — callers that
 * bring their own mine lambda via [enqueueStaged]/[enqueueWork] should reuse
 * this value to stay inside the queue's CPU budget. Jobs are cancellable
 * while QUEUED or MINING; once PUBLISHING starts, cancel is a no-op.
 *
 * Template jobs enqueued with a [PersistedPoWJob] record are checkpointed to
 * [persistence]. The checkpoint is deleted only after the [onMined]
 * continuation COMPLETES (publish included) or the user cancels — never at
 * mining-complete — so a process death mid-sign or mid-broadcast is replayed
 * by the restorer on the next login. A continuation that throws keeps its
 * checkpoint (retry on restart) and reports through [failures]. Opaque
 * [enqueueWork] jobs (reactions, reposts — and anonymous posts, deliberately,
 * so a throwaway key and its content never touch disk) stay in-memory only.
 *
 * [onQueueActive] fires on every enqueue; the Android layer uses it to start
 * the mining foreground service so backgrounding the app doesn't freeze the
