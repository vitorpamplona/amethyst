/**
 * What a subscription's declared [SubPurpose] means for a NIP-42 auth prompt.
 *
 * Every filter the app opens is built as an
 * [ExplainedFilter][com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.relayClient.subscriptions.ExplainedFilter],
 * which records *why* it exists at the point it is constructed. The auth path used to throw that
 * away and re-infer intent from the filter's tag shape, which is wrong in two common cases:
 *
 * - **Reading your own inbox.** Notifications and DMs are `#p` = me with no `authors`, so they match
 *   no shape rule at all. The prompt fell through to the blank "Use this relay" wording, or borrowed
 *   the label of unrelated pending traffic sharing the socket — announcing an outbound notification
 *   while the user was reading.
 * - **Reading a thread.** Reactions/zaps are fetched with `#e` against *note ids*
 *   (`ReactionsFilterAssembler`), which is shape-identical to reading a NIP-28 channel. The prompt
 *   asked "Open 3f8a12c9?" about a note that was never a room.
 *
 * Returning `null` means "this purpose says nothing useful about identity disclosure" — the caller
 * falls back to tag-shape inference, which is still the right answer for a plain
 * [Filter][com.vitorpamplona.quartz.nip01Core.relay.filters.Filter] built outside the assemblers.
