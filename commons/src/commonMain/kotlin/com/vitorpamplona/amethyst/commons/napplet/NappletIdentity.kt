 * Keyed by the **addressable coordinate** — the manifest author's pubkey plus the
 * `d` identifier — and deliberately **not** the bundle's content hash, so a user's
 * grants survive routine code updates. The current [aggregateHash] is carried
 * alongside (the sha256 of the verified /index.html artifact for NIP-5D;
 * the property name is retained for persisted ledger compatibility) so a user who chose "ask again when the
 * code changes" can be re-prompted when the bundle actually changes.
 *
 * [identifier] is empty for a root (kind 15129) napplet and the `d` value for a
 * named (kind 35129) one.
