/**
 * The **receive** half of Concord's key lifecycle, as pure functions: what a client must adopt
 * when a Grant hands it the Control Plane write key (CORD-04 §3), and how an entry is rewritten
 * when a base rotation moves the community to a new epoch (CORD-06).
 *
 * These lived only in Amethyst's `AccountConcordActions`, which meant a headless client (`amy`)
 * could hold a rank it could never write under, and could not follow a Refounding at all. The
 * logic is platform-agnostic — the only Android-shaped parts were the persistence and publish,
 * which stay with the caller. Every function here decides *what* to adopt and returns it; the
 * caller owns storing it and republishing the kind-13302 list.
 *
 * Everything fails closed: an undecryptable, mis-epoched or non-deriving delivery yields null,
 * never a partially-adopted entry.

     *    split us off from the plane's readers.
