/**
 * Per-user temporary directory at `~/.amethyst/tmp/`, mode 0700 on
 * POSIX systems. Used by the image compression pipeline so:
 *
 * - tmpfs-mounted `/tmp` on Linux doesn't OOM under a 50 MP HEIC
 *   decode (a 600 MB intermediate easily exceeds a small VM's
 *   tmpfs allotment),
 * - shared multi-user systems can't race on a predictably-named temp
 *   file in world-readable `/tmp`,
 * - the boot-time sweep has a strict ownership claim — anything in
 *   this directory belongs to us.
 *
 * The directory may be overridden via `-Damethyst.tmp.dir=PATH`,
 * useful for tests.
