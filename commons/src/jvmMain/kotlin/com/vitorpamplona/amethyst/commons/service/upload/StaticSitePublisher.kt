/**
 * Uploads a local directory (or single file) to a Blossom server and produces the NIP-5A
 * `path → sha256` tags a static-site / napplet manifest needs. Each file is content-addressed by its
 * own sha256, signed-uploaded via [BlossomClient] + [BlossomAuth], and mapped to an absolute web path
 * (`/index.html`, `/assets/app.js`, …) so the same tree resolves the same way the host serves it.
 *
 * This is the reusable "ship a directory" half of publishing; the caller turns [Result.pathTags] into
 * the actual NIP-5A/5D event (kind 15128/35128 or 15129/35129), signs and broadcasts it. Lives next
 * to [BlossomClient] in `jvmMain` so the CLI and the desktop app share one upload path.
