/**
 * User-configurable set of relays used to fetch profile metadata
 * (kind 0) and follow lists (kind 3) — the "index relays" set passed
 * to `FeedMetadataCoordinator` in the Desktop app and to `wot sync`
 * in `amy`.
 *
 * Backed by [java.util.prefs.Preferences] at a fixed node
 * `com/vitorpamplona/amethyst/relays/index` (JVM-user-scoped). The
 * shared node means Desktop and `amy` running as the same OS user
 * observe the same setting without extra plumbing — the same trick
 * `PreferencesHashtagSpamSettings` uses for the hashtag-spam filter.
 *
 * Not per-account: users typically have a single preferred set of
 * index relays regardless of which account is currently logged in.
 * If per-account overrides become necessary later, layer a per-user
 * key on top; this class stays the base.
 *
 * CSV serialisation for the persisted value matches what
 * `DesktopAccountRelays` uses for its categories — no JSON dep, no
 * `Serializable` contract. URLs are normalised via
 * [RelayUrlNormalizer.normalizeOrNull] at both write and read time so
 * malformed entries never enter the effective set.
