/**
 * Image compression quality presets. JPEG quality values are tuned for

 * produce visible blocking on modern displays.
 *
 * @property displayName Human-readable label for settings UI and the
 *   per-post override chip.
 * @property maxDim Maximum width OR height in pixels for the encoded
 *   output. The image keeps its aspect ratio; the longer edge clamps to
 *   this value. ImageReencoder enforces "never upscale": if both source
 *   dimensions are already within this box, the source dims are kept
 *   and only the JPEG re-encode runs.
 * @property jpegQuality JPEG quality factor in [0.0, 1.0] passed to
 *   `javax.imageio.ImageWriteParam.setCompressionQuality(...)`.
