/**
 * The Android [CordnBlobCipher]: AES-GCM under a key held in the Android
 * KeyStore (StrongBox-backed where the device has it).
 *
 * ## Why there is no lock here any more
 *
 * There used to be one. [KeyStoreEncryption] kept a single `Cipher` in a field
 * and ran `init(...)` then `doFinal(...)` against it, which is not atomic, so
 * two groups saving at once on `Dispatchers.IO` could interleave and write
 * bytes encrypted under the wrong IV — unrecoverable for an `MlsGroupState`.
 *
 * [KeyStoreEncryption] now holds its `Cipher` in a `ThreadLocal`, so the pair
 * can no longer interleave and the lock guards nothing. Keeping it would
 * serialise every cordn group save and load on this device for no reason,
 * which is the opposite of what a thread pool is for.

    // [CordnBlobCipher] directly, which is what the seam is for.
    // Built on first use, not at construction. This cipher is reached from
    // CordnRuntime, which Account builds eagerly, so a KeyStoreEncryption that
    // throws here takes the whole account down before any UI exists — the app
    // sits on "Loading account" forever. Every other user of KeyStoreEncryption
    // already guards it (AccountCacheState falls back to an in-memory Marmot
    // store); deferring keeps a cordn-only failure inside cordn.
