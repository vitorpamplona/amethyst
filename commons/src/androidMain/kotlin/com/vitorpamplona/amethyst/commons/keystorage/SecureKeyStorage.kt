/**
 * Android implementation of [SecureKeyStorage]: an encrypted DataStore whose
 * values are sealed with a key held in the AndroidKeyStore.
 *
 * ## Why not EncryptedSharedPreferences
 *
 * This used to be `androidx.security.crypto`, which Google deprecated with no
 * drop-in successor. [SecretEncryption] talks to the AndroidKeyStore directly —
 * AES-256-GCM, StrongBox-backed where the device offers it — so the key still
 * never enters app memory, and the library goes away.
 *
 * Nothing is migrated from the old `amethyst_secure_keys` file because nothing
 * ever wrote to it: this class is used by the desktop app, and the Android app
 * has its own key storage in LocalPreferences. Were that to change, a migration
 * would have to come first.
 *
 * ## Security note
 *
 * Only values are encrypted; the key names are not. That reveals which npubs
 * this installation holds keys for, but not the keys themselves — the same
 * trade-off the rest of the encrypted stores make.
 *
 * The String memory limitation described on [SecureKeyStorage] still applies:
 * a decrypted private key cannot be zeroed from a JVM String.
