/**
 * The shell page's own contents, asserted where the resource can actually be read.
 *
 * This lives in `jvmTest` rather than `commonTest` because [NappletWebContract.shellHtml] goes
 * through Compose Resources, and that reader needs an initialised Android `Context` on the
 * android target. A host unit test has none, so running this in `commonTest` failed
 * `:commons:testAndroidHostTest` with `MissingResourceException` while passing `:commons:jvmTest`
 * — the same assertion, red or green depending only on which target ran it.
 *
 * Nothing about the assertions is platform-specific: `shell.html` is one shared file, so reading
 * it once on the JVM checks its contents everywhere. What is *not* covered here is the Android
 * resource plumbing itself, which needs a `Context` — an instrumented test, or Robolectric, which
 * commons does not use.
 *
 * The rest of the contract's tests stay in `commonTest` and still run on both targets; they never
 * touch a resource.
