/**
 * The local search engine, checked against a real relay's answers over a real corpus.
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot prove
 *
 * The oracle is `search-staging.brainstorm.world`, a vespa-relay — the same software Amethyst's
 * token language was ported from. It is a **valid oracle for NIP-01 filtering** and **not one for
 * NIP-50 text matching**, and the difference is the whole design of this file.
 *
 * NIP-01 is a closed specification: given `kinds`, `#t`, `since` and `until`, either an event
 * satisfies the filter or it does not, and there is exactly one right answer. Every event the
 * relay chose to return for a filter must therefore satisfy that filter under our matcher too.
 * Across the recorded corpus that holds for 64 of 64 events, and [everyEventTheRelayReturnedSatisfiesTheFilterItAnsweredFor]
 * pins it.
 *
 * NIP-50 is not closed. This relay retrieves topically, not lexically: asked for `bitcoin` it
 * returns a block-height summary that never says "bitcoin", and asked for `nostr` it returns "made
 * my display name refer to my npub's last characters". Eight of the 64 recorded events — 12% —
 * contain no literal occurrence of the term that fetched them.
 *
 * The fixture is recorded with the `include:spam` lens, which waives the web-of-trust gate. That
 * was measured, not assumed: waiving it makes the corpus reproducible (the alternative,
 * `observer:<pubkey>`, pins every answer to one account's trust graph) but it does not make
 * retrieval lexical — the divergence actually widens, from 4 events to 8, because dropping the
 * gate lets more topical matches through. Asserting that
 * our substring matcher reproduces those results would encode someone else's semantic expansion as
 * a requirement on a lexical matcher — a test that fails on correct code. So this file deliberately
 * makes **no** claim that our text results equal the relay's, and
 * [theRelayRetrievesSemanticallyWhichIsWhyTextResultsAreNotCompared] documents the divergence as a
 * fact about the corpus rather than a failure.
 *
 * What the corpus is still worth beyond that: 64 events of real, adversarial content — newlines,
 * currency symbols, URLs, multi-byte text, empty tag arrays — to run the rest of the engine over.
