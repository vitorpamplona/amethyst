/**
 * The My Fitness dashboard renders before Health Connect's per-session metrics have arrived —
 * each of those costs its own IPC, so waiting for all of them is what made the screen sit on a
 * spinner. These tests pin what that first pass is allowed to look like.
 *
 * The contract has two halves, and the screen depends on both:
 *  - everything not derived from a metric must already be final, so no visible number *changes*
 *    when the metrics land — it only gains cells;
 *  - a metric that is not known yet must read as absent, never as zero, so the screen hides its
 *    cell instead of claiming the user ran 0 km.
