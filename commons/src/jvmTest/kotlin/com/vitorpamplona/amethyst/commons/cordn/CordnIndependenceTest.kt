/**
 * The app half of the Marmot/cordn boundary.
 *
 * `quartz`'s `BindingIsolationTest` holds the protocol layer apart. This holds
 * the layer above it apart, and the rule is the same and deliberate: **Marmot is
 * frozen, and neither binding may acquire a reason to change when the other
 * does.** The two protocols do not interoperate and neither is a layer of the
 * other, so a shared model, state holder or chatroom type would be a coupling
 * with nothing to justify it.
 *
 * What cordn *may* share is what any feature shares: the design system, the
 * theme, and generic components — buttons, avatars, text fields, QR, media
 * viewers. Those are app furniture, not group chat. The line this test draws is
 * `marmot`-named code, because that is where the coupling would actually land.
