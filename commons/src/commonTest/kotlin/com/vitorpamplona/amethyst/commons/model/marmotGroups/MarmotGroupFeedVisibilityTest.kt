/**
 * Which inner app events become rows in a Marmot group's conversation.
 *
 * The kind:1210 rule is a security boundary, not a display preference. MLS
 * authenticates that a member SENT a payload; it says nothing about whether the
 * payload is TRUE. The reference client draws the same line — its own fuzz
 * target asserts that raw 1210 JSON "must not authenticate a payload actor" and
 * that a parsed payload stays an unauthenticated projection.
