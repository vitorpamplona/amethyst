# Web of Trust network index (NIP-85 kind 30382, ~300k users)

Status: **implemented 2026-10-07** (phases 1–5 except public chats and `amy wot`; see §7).

## 1. Goal

Know, in under a microsecond and without a network call, whether a pubkey is inside the
logged-in user's extended network and how much the user's trust provider trusts them.
The answer gates:

- DMs: the **Known** vs **New Requests** split.
- Notifications: the existing **Curated** filter (`TopFilter.Selected`).
- Replies, and possibly public chat messages (later phases).
- The rank / follower-count badges, which today come from a per-profile relay subscription.

The source is the user's NIP-85 trust provider: one kind 30382 card per member of the
network, all signed by the provider key named in the user's kind 10040. The first provider
we onboard is Brainstorm (GrapeRank), from a new **Web of Trust** settings screen. That
screen also sets the minimum accepted score, default **5**.

## 2. What we measured (2026-10-07)

All numbers come from the live `wss://scores.brainstorm.world`. That is the relay real
Brainstorm 10040s point at, and the one Brainstorm's web app uses
(`VITE_NIP85_RELAY_URL`). Two real per-user provider keys were tested.

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Relay | strfry, `max_limit` **100,000**, NIP-45 COUNT and NIP-77 negentropy supported |
| Older relay `nip85.brainstorm.world` | `max_limit` **500**, negentropy supported. Some 10040s in the wild (fiatjaf's fixture) still point here. |
| Cards per user | **154,755** and **149,609** |
| Card size | ~520 B of JSON. Tags: `d`, `rank`, `followers`, `reporters`, `muters`, `client`, `hops` |
| Cold download | **93 MB / 34 s** (155k cards, 2 REQs of 100k, from a datacenter). gzip shrinks the stream ~3.3×. |
| Shared timestamps | **80,577** cards of one user carry the *same* `created_at`, because the provider publishes in batches. |
| Churn | Provider A: 9,704 cards re-signed in 3 days, 25,779 in 30 days. Provider B: all 155k re-signed today. |
| Deletions | Provider A has **169,317** kind-5 events, each carrying many `a` tags (`30382:<P>:<target>`). |
| Rank (0–100) | ≥ 5: **77,270 / 154,755** and **75,283 / 149,609**, so about half the network passes the default. Provider B also has 749 rank-0 cards. |
| Event-object heap | 300k card-shaped events ≈ **254 MB** (~850 B each), before `Note`/`User`/flows |
| Lookup, 310k keys (JVM) | `HashSet<String>` 0.1–0.25 µs but ~14 MB plus the strings. Sorted `LongArray` with hex parse ~0.4–0.5 µs at 2.5 MB. |
| Index file load (JVM) | 6.3 MB file, read and decoded in **14–40 ms** |
| Signature check | ~75 µs per event on JVM, 1–2k events/s parse+verify on a phone (`quartz/plans/2026-07-02-nostrclient-receiver-perf.md`). That is minutes for 300k. |

### Phase 0 on the JVM: download → verify → build → save (2026-10-07)

`quartz/src/jvmTest/.../prodbench/WotNetworkIndexBenchmark.kt` (opt-in with
`-PprodRelayBench=1`) runs the real Quartz stack: `NostrClient` + `fetchAllPages`, Schnorr
verify, the D5/D6 index layout, and the D11 files. Observer
`460c25e6…065c`, whose 10040 names rank provider `7d7ffd72…9377` on
`wss://scores.brainstorm.world`. Run from a 4-core cloud container.

| Stage | Result |
|---|---|
| Download (3 pages, `DRAINED`) | **5.2 s**, 151,831 cards, ~29k cards/s |
| Heap if events are held | 84.6 MB (556 B per parsed card), which the one-pass pipeline avoids |
| Verify every signature (4 cores) | **3.2 s**, 0 invalid, ~48k verifies/s (83 µs per verify per core) |
| Build index (sort, dedupe, drop rank 0) | **0.39 s**, 151,153 entries; **77,671 with rank ≥ 5** |
| Save index + ids files | **0.23 s**; index **3.3 MB**, ids **6.0 MB** |
| Load + decode index | **34 ms** first, 17 ms best |
| Lookup (hex read + binary search) | ~400 ns |
| **One pass** (verify while downloading, no events held, then build + save) | **8.5 s** total: download done at 7.9 s, last verify at 8.0 s |

Notes:
- Paging by `until` worked here (`DRAINED`), because this relay's `max_limit` is 100k.
- At 300k, expect roughly double: about 15–20 s on this hardware.
- The build stage used a boxed sort; a primitive sort will be faster.
- **Not measured yet: a phone.** Signature checks dominate the CPU there (the perf plan
  puts parse plus verify at 1–2k/s), so expect minutes, not seconds. That run is still
  needed for D9b/D9c.

How Brainstorm publishes (read from `NosFabrica/brainstorm_server`,
`app/message_queue_tasks/upload_nostr_events.py`):

- **Score runs.** Scores are recomputed on a schedule (default `schedule_interval_seconds = 604800`, 7 days) or on demand. In steady state only changed scores are published; an occasional full sync re-asserts every card above the cutoff.
- **Removal.** When someone falls out of the network, Brainstorm first publishes a **rank-0 card with no `hops`**, then a kind-5 deletion by `a` tag. The zero card is there "so that even if the relay rejects kind 5, the score is effectively zeroed out".
- **Provider keys are per user.** `authors=[P]` returns exactly that user's network and nothing else.

## 3. What exists today (survey)

| Piece | Where | Reuse? |
|---|---|---|
| 10040 parsing, provider slots | `commons/.../model/trustedAssertions/TrustProviderListState.kt` (`liveUserRankProvider`, `liveUserFollowerCount`), with local backup in `AccountSettings.backupTrustProviderList` | Reuse as is |
| Per-profile rank/followers | `UserCardsCache.rankFlow` / `followerCountStrFlow`, read at `commonsUI/.../AccountUserObservers.kt:470,485`. Cards are fetched per profile by `UserCardsSubAssembler` and stored as `AddressableNote`s in `LocalCache`. | Migrate (D16) |
| Relay ops | `fetchAllPages` (streams, pages by `until`, reports `UNPAGEABLE`), `negentropyReconcile` + `NegentropyLocalIndex`, `count`, `ParallelEventVerifier`, `AdaptiveRelayLimiter` in `quartz/.../relay/client/accessories/` | Reuse |
| Compact hex keys | `Hex.readLong(hex, offset)`, `Hex.toLong128` in `quartz/utils/Hex.kt`. `SeenIds` uses the same 128-bit-prefix idea for event ids. | Reuse |
| Per-account files | `AccountCacheState.createAccount` makes `filesDir/accounts/<pubkey>/` (`:275`); `deleteAccountFiles` removes it on logoff; okio `platformFileSystem`; `atomicWrite` pattern in `FileCordnStores.kt` | Reuse |
| Synced settings | `AccountSyncedSettings` (NIP-78 kind 30078 `AmethystSettings`) | Add `minTrustScore` |
| Foreground signal | `ForegroundTracker.isForeground` (Android) | Trigger for small updates |
| Background work | WorkManager (`NotificationCatchUpWorker`, `ScheduledPostWorker`, which resolves the account from `accountsCache`) | Weekly full check |
| DM split | `ChatroomListKnownFeedFilter.kt:70-78` / `ChatroomListNewFeedFilter.kt:47-56` (incremental path `:167-173`). Known = a sender is followed, or I sent a message. | Extend |
| Notifications | `NotificationFeedFilter.kt:712` author gate; Curated = `TopFilter.Selected` | Extend |
| Push notifications | Renderers apply only `account.isAcceptable(note)` and never the notification TopFilter | Decide (D18) |
| Replies | `ThreadLevelCalculator.kt:109-114` sorts into tiers (thread author, me, follows, rest) | Extend later |
| Friends-of-friends | `commons/wot/WoTService.kt`: Desktop-only badge, in memory, not persisted | Independent, no change |
| 10040 editing UI | None in the app; only `amy graperank register` | New screen |

There is **no Android event store**. `LocalCache` lives only in memory, and every event received
on the shared client is filed into it by `CacheClientConnector`
(`AppModules.kt:873`: `EventCollector(client) { cache.justConsume(...) }`).

## 4. Decisions

Each has a recommendation (**Rec.**) or a recorded decision. The ones still marked **❓** are
open; §6 logs what was decided.

### D1. Which provider feeds the index
Use the 10040 entry whose service is `30382:rank` (`liveUserRankProvider`): its pubkey `P`
and relay hint `R`. That is one provider, with no multi-provider merge (NIP-85 doesn't
specify one). Brainstorm is only the onboarding path; any NIP-85 provider listed under
`30382:rank` works the same way.

**Rec.** A change of `P` or `R` (new 10040, re-registration) throws the index away and
starts a fresh cold sync. The file header records `(P, R)` so a mismatch is detected on load.

### D2. Membership rule
`accepted(pk) = pk == me || pk ∈ follows || (indexReady && rank(pk) >= minScore)`

- Follows always pass, so a stale provider never demotes someone you follow.
- **No card means outside the network.** Brainstorm only publishes above its cutoff.
- **A rank-0 card counts as removed** (Brainstorm's removal marker), as does a card
  deleted by kind 5.
- Mutes, blocks and spam flags still win over everything (`isHidden` is checked first, as today).
- `hops` is stored but **not** used to gate (D7).

### D3. Before the index is ready
When the index is missing, still downloading, or there is no rank provider, every surface
behaves **exactly as today**. Otherwise the first sync would empty the DM list and
notifications for minutes. "Ready" means a complete snapshot for the current `(P, R)` is loaded.

"Missing" and "not loaded yet" are different states:
- **Missing** (no file, or a `(P, R)` mismatch): let everything through, as today.
- **On disk but not loaded yet** (a process just started, e.g. by a push): **wait for the
  load**, bounded by a timeout, before deciding. Push filtering depends on this (D11, D18);
  otherwise every notification that wakes a cold process would skip the filter.

### D4. Use LocalCache? **No.**
- **Size.** 300k cards ≈ 254 MB for the event objects alone, plus 300k `AddressableNote`s and the `User` objects `about.cards()` creates, against ~6 MB for the index.
- **Nothing persists.** LocalCache is in memory only on Android, so it would have to re-download every start.
- **The shared client files everything.** `CacheClientConnector` puts every event on the shared client into LocalCache, so the sync **must use its own client** (D8).

LocalCache keeps what it has today: the account's **own** contact cards (encrypted
nicknames, signed by the account, `UserAssertionsState`) and any 30382 that arrives
incidentally.

### D5. Key width in the index
| Option | Bytes / entry | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| 64-bit prefix | 8 | Grinding a key whose first 64 bits match *some* member is roughly 2^64 / 300k ≈ 2^46 key generations. Our estimate: about a day of GPU vanity grinding, which buys a spammer a place in Known. |
| **128-bit prefix** | 16 | Not feasible to grind; random collisions are effectively zero |
| Full 256 bits | 32 | No gain over 128 for this purpose |

**Rec.** 128-bit: two longs per entry, sorted, via `Hex.readLong(pk, 0)` / `Hex.readLong(pk, 16)`
(no allocation).

### D6. In-memory structure
An immutable `NetworkSnapshot`:

```
keys      LongArray(2N)   sorted by (hi, lo) — binary search, ~19 steps at 300k
rank      ByteArray(N)    0..100 (clamped; unsigned read)
hops      ByteArray(N)    0..127, -1 = unknown
followers IntArray(N)
provider, relay, syncCursor, lastFullCheck, version
```

- Published as `StateFlow<NetworkSnapshot?>`. Each update builds a new snapshot and swaps
  it in atomically; readers never lock.
- About 6.3 MB at 300k. Alternatives considered:
  - Open-addressing hash: same size, O(1), but needs a rehash on load and gives no sorted merge.
  - `HashSet<String>`: 7–8× the memory.
- **❓ D6a.** Also memoize the two prefix longs on `User` so hot paths skip the hex read?
  **Rec.** Not in v1: `Hex.readLong` is cheap and allocation-free. Revisit if profiling says otherwise.

### D7. Which tag values to keep
Keep `rank` (the gate), `followers` (the badge), and `hops` (cheap, useful for UI such as
"3 hops away").

**Decided: don't store `reporters` / `muters`.** Brainstorm publishes these counts of people
in your network who reported or muted someone; they would cost 2 × 4 B × N ≈ 2.4 MB. The
file format is versioned, so this can be revisited without a migration.

### D8. Relay client for the sync
**A second `NostrClient`** with the same `websocketBuilder`, so Tor routing and the relay
blocklist still apply. It is **not** wrapped by `CacheClientConnector`, is created for a sync
and disconnected afterwards. This also keeps the bulk sync from using up the shared
client's subscription slots. Desktop already does this for its kind-10050 indexer client
(`Main.kt:1039`).

### D9. Cold download
1. Read NIP-11 for `R`: `max_limit`, `max_subscriptions`, negentropy support.
2. **Path A (preferred when `max_limit` ≥ ~100k):** `fetchAllPages(R, {kinds:[30382], authors:[P]})`, streaming into a growing set of arrays. Events are never held.
3. **Path B (when A ends `UNPAGEABLE`):** if one second holds more cards than `max_limit` (likely on `nip85.brainstorm.world`), use `negentropyReconcile` with an empty local side to list the ids, then fetch them in batches of 500 by id. The perf plan measured fetch-by-id at up to 30–40k/s on a 33k-event corpus.
4. Sort, deduplicate by d-tag (newest `created_at` wins), drop rank 0, write the file (D11), swap the snapshot in.
5. Every event must have `kind == 30382`, `pubkey == P`, and a 64-hex d-tag. Anything else is dropped.

**D9a. Signature checks — decided: check every signature.** A relay that inserts forged
cards could otherwise make strangers "known". Use `ParallelEventVerifier` on low-priority
threads, so its backlog limit slows the socket instead of growing memory. This is roughly
2.5–5 min of CPU on a phone for the cold sync, once; small updates and the full check (D12)
verify too. A failed signature drops that event.

**❓ D9b. Resuming an interrupted cold download.** A 70–180 MB download on mobile can be killed.
**Rec.** v1 restarts from scratch but writes a "pages done" checkpoint (the `until` cursor
plus partial arrays to a `.partial` file), so Path A can resume. That is cheap to add because
`fetchAllPages` reports each page boundary (`onNewPage`).

**❓ D9c. Network policy.** The cold sync is 50–180 MB.
**Rec.** Run it on any network when the user starts it from the settings screen (they are
looking at a progress bar). Background cold syncs (e.g. after a provider change on another
device) wait for an unmetered network.

### D10. Small updates
The trigger is the app coming to the foreground (`ForegroundTracker`), plus right after the
user asks Brainstorm to recompute. It runs only if the last update was more than **12 h** ago,
since Brainstorm recomputes weekly by default.

1. `cursor = snapshot.syncCursor - 3600` (one hour of overlap absorbs batches sharing a timestamp and late relay arrivals).
2. `COUNT {kinds:[30382], authors:[P], since: cursor}`. If it exceeds about 20k and the network is metered, postpone; it is effectively a full re-publish.
3. Fetch `{kinds:[30382], authors:[P], since: cursor}` and `{kinds:[5], authors:[P], since: cursor}`.
4. Merge: upsert cards (newest per d-tag); rank 0 or a kind-5 `a` tag `30382:P:<target>` removes the entry.
5. Write the file, swap the snapshot in, and advance the cursor to the newest `created_at` seen.

### D11. On disk
A single file per account: `filesDir/accounts/<pubkey>/wot/network-v1.bin`. It lives inside the
account directory, so the existing `deleteAccountFiles` cleans it up on logoff.

```
magic "AWOT" | u16 version | 32B provider | relay (u16 len + utf8)
| i64 syncCursor | i64 lastFullCheck | i32 N
| keys  N×16 | rank N×1 | hops N×1 | followers N×4
```

- Written with okio to a temp file and then moved into place (`atomicWrite`), so a crash
  leaves the old file or the new one, never half.
- Read with one `readByteArray` and decoded on `Dispatchers.IO` as soon as the `Account` is
  created, including accounts loaded only for push. 14–40 ms on JVM; phase 0 measures it on a
  phone.
- **Loading must be fast because push filtering waits on it** (D3). Consumers call a
  suspending `awaitLoaded(timeout)`; a cold process that a notification wakes pays the load
  once.
- If phase 0 shows the decode is too slow on low-end phones, the fallback is a jvmAndroid
  `actual` that memory-maps the file and binary-searches the mapped `LongBuffer` directly:
  no decode, the OS pages it in on demand. The format above already allows this (fixed-width
  sections, big-endian).
- A bad magic, version, or `(P, R)` mismatch means the file is ignored and a cold sync is scheduled.

A second file `network-ids-v1.bin` holds `(eventId 32B, createdAt i64)` per entry, about
12 MB. It is **kept** (decided) and read **only** by the weekly full check (D12), never at
startup. It is written together with the index, so the two always describe the same set.

### D12. Weekly full check
Purpose: catch deletions or rank-0 cards we missed (a relay outage, an update window
overflow).

- **Cheap check first.** `COUNT {kinds:[30382], authors:[P]}` against `N + removedSinceLastFull`. If they match, stop.
- **Otherwise** run `negentropyReconcile` against `network-ids-v1.bin` through a
  `NegentropyLocalIndex` adapter: fetch the ids we need, drop the ids only we have.
- On Android this is a WorkManager periodic job (unmetered, battery not low) that resolves
  the account from `accountsCache` like `ScheduledPostWorker`.

Decided: keep the ids file and use negentropy; no periodic full re-download.

### D13. Multiple accounts
Several `Account`s can be live at once: background notifications load every writable
account.
- Every live account with a rank provider **loads** its index (~6 MB each), so push
  filtering works for all of them.
- Only the **active** account runs the foreground update.
- The weekly worker goes through every account with a rank provider.

### D14. Settings model
| Setting | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Provider (P, R) | the 10040 itself (already on relays, backed up locally) | One source of truth, interoperable |
| `minTrustScore` (default 5) | `AccountSyncedSettings` (NIP-78) | A preference that should follow the user across devices |
| Brainstorm session token | memory only | Expires after 60 min (`AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`); re-login just asks for one signature |
| Sync state | the index header | Local by nature |

**D14a. No separate switch — decided.** WoT filtering is on whenever the 10040 has a
`30382:rank` provider. Removing the provider (from the settings screen) turns it off.

Consequence to handle in the release: users who already have a 10040 from elsewhere will see
DM Known/New, Curated notifications and replies change after the update, once their first
sync finishes. The settings screen should show "Filtering by <provider>, minimum score N"
and the sync progress, so the change can be explained and undone.

### D15. Brainstorm onboarding (from `brainstorm_server` and `Brainstorm-UI` sources)
Base URL `https://api.brainstorm.world`; the NIP-85 relay is `wss://scores.brainstorm.world`.

1. `GET /authChallenge/{pubkey}` returns `{data:{challenge}}`.
2. Sign a **kind 22242** with tags `["t","brainstorm_login"]` and `["challenge", c]`, then
   `POST /authChallenge/{pubkey}/verify` with `{signed_event}`, which returns `{data:{token}}`.
   Login also creates the user's per-user service key on the server.
3. Authenticated calls send the header `access_token: <token>`.
4. `POST /user/graperank` triggers a score run. It needs at least one follow, is throttled to
   once per 30 min, and can return 429 when a tier's quota is used up.
5. `GET /user/history` returns `ta_pubkey` (the service key `P`) and
   `last_time_calculated_graperank`.
6. Sign a kind 10040 that **merges** into the existing list (keep other entries, public and
   private) the entries `["30382:rank", P, R]` and `["30382:followers", P, R]`, using
   `TrustProviderListEvent.add`. Publish to the outbox relays.
7. Once `last_time_calculated_graperank` is set (poll `/user/history`, or poll `COUNT` until it
   is above 0), start the cold sync (D9).

**Details of this step:**
- **D15a. Public or private 10040 entries — decided: both.** Reading already handles both
  (`liveTrustProviderList` decrypts the private side). Onboarding offers the choice, with
  **public** as the default: Brainstorm's web app recognises only public entries
  (`declaresTrustProvider`), and other clients can only use public ones. Private hides which
  provider you use, at the cost of that interop. `TrustProviderListEvent.add(..., isPrivate)`
  already supports both.
- **D15b. An existing 10040 points at another rank provider.** **Rec.** Warn and ask before replacing it, as Brainstorm's UI does. Never replace silently.
- **D15c. Signers.** Two signatures (22242, 10040) go through the normal `NostrSigner`, so NIP-55 and NIP-46 signers work. Each call is a prompt for users who approve manually.
- **D15d. Free vs paid tiers.** `brainstorm_server` has billing tiers and manual-run quotas (`enforce_manual_quota`). The UI should surface 403/429 as "recomputed recently / quota reached", not as a failure.
- **D15e. Any NIP-85 provider — decided.** The index, sync and filtering work with any
  provider listed under `30382:rank`. Two ways to set one up:
  - **Manual (any provider):** enter or paste the provider's service pubkey and relay; we
    write the 10040 entries. This needs no knowledge of the provider's API.
  - **Guided sign-up, one adapter per provider:** NIP-85 does not specify how to create an
    account with a provider or obtain its service key, so each provider's sign-up is its own
    integration behind a small interface, e.g. `TrustProviderOnboarding { login(); requestScores(); serviceKey(); relay }`.
    Brainstorm (above) is the first adapter; others are added one by one as their APIs are
    known.

### D16. Rank and follower count move to the index
- **Rec.** `rankFlow` and `followerCountStrFlow` read the snapshot (`snapshotFlow.map { it.rank(user) }`) when the index is ready **and** `P` is the provider for that slot. Brainstorm registers the same key for `rank` and `followers`.
- Otherwise they fall back to today's per-profile path, so users without WoT see no change.
- When the index serves both slots, `UserCardsSubAssembler` stops asking `R` for provider cards for each profile on screen, and keeps fetching only the account's own cards (nicknames).
- Someone outside the network shows no rank. That matches today, since the provider has no card for them.

### D17. Refreshing feeds when the snapshot or threshold changes
DM Known/New and the notification feed are additive filters; they won't re-check old items on their own.
- **Rec.** Expose `snapshotVersion: StateFlow<Long>` combined with `minTrustScore`.
- Their view models force a full refresh when either changes, debounced about 500 ms.
- The notification filter already rebuilds when `feedKey()` changes (it includes the TopFilter code), so adding `minTrustScore` and a WoT-ready flag to that key may be enough there.

### D18. Consumers, one by one
| Surface | Change | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| DM Known | `senderIntersects(follows) \|\| hasSentMessagesTo \|\| (rankProvider != null && activeSenders.any { accepted })`. New stays its exact opposite, including the incremental path at `:167-173`. Group DMs: **any** accepted sender makes the room Known, matching how follows work today. | 4 |
| Notifications, Curated | Gate the author (`NotificationFeedFilter.kt:712`): `isAuthorInFollows \|\| accepted(author)` when `followList()` is `Selected` and a rank provider exists. Zaps are already handled: `notifAuthor` resolves a `ZapReceiptEvent` to the zap *request* sender, including private zaps (`:615-621`). | 4 |
| Push notifications | **Decided: apply Curated filtering to push too.** Today push applies only `account.isAcceptable`. When the account's notification filter is Curated, the push path (`EventNotificationConsumer` / the renderers) uses the same author check as the in-app feed, after `awaitLoaded` (D3). Ideally both call one shared predicate so they cannot drift. | 4 |
| Replies | **Decided: collapse replies from outside the network** behind "N more replies from outside your network", expandable on tap. Follows, me and the thread author are never collapsed. Sorting tiers stay as they are. | 5 |
| Public chats / live chat | Not decided. Phase 5, revisit after replies ship. | 5 |

### D19. Where code lives
| Piece | Module / package |
|---|---|
| `NetworkSnapshot` (arrays, lookup, merge, binary codec) | `quartz/.../nip85TrustedAssertions/users/index/`. Pure NIP-85 utility, no UI, KMP. |
| Sync (cold, update, full check) as `INostrClient` extensions | `quartz/.../nip85TrustedAssertions/users/index/` beside it |
| `WebOfTrustNetworkState` (load, save, schedule, `StateFlow`, accepted()) | `commons/.../wot/`, owned by `Account` |
| `TrustProviderOnboarding` interface + manual setup | `commons/.../wot/onboarding/` |
| Brainstorm adapter (HTTP client, sign-up flow) | `commons/.../wot/onboarding/brainstorm/` |
| Settings screen, strings | `commonsUI` (strings in `composeResources`, per CLAUDE.md) |
| WorkManager job, foreground trigger | `amethyst/` shim |
| `amy wot sync \| check <npub> \| stats \| brainstorm login\|register` | `cli/`, a thin layer over the above |
| Desktop | wired through `DesktopIAccount` once the one-UI move reaches it; the core is already shared |

## 5. Phases

0. **Measure first.** *(JVM part done, see §2; phone still pending.)* `amy wot sync` against a real ~300k network: wall time, bytes, signature-check time, peak heap. Repeat on a mid-range phone through a debug button, and measure the cold index load there (decides whether D11 needs the memory-mapped fallback, and settles D9b/D9c).
1. **Index + storage + sync** (quartz/commons) with unit tests:
   - file format round trip;
   - merge, rank-0 and kind-5 removal;
   - the shared-timestamp `UNPAGEABLE` → negentropy fallback;
   - `(P, R)` mismatch.
2. **Account wiring + D16**: rank and follower badges served from the index; drop the per-profile provider subscriptions.
3. **Web of Trust settings**: current provider and sync status, the min-score slider with a live "N of M people pass" count, manual provider setup, and the Brainstorm adapter (D14, D15).
4. **Consumers**: DM Known/New, Curated notifications in-app and in push (D18).
5. **Collapse out-of-network replies**; then revisit chats (D18).

## 6. Decisions log

Settled on 2026-10-07:

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D9a | Check every signature (cold sync, updates, full check). |
| D11 / D12 | Keep the ids file; the weekly full check uses negentropy against it. |
| D14a | No separate switch: filtering is on whenever a `30382:rank` provider exists. |
| D15a | Support public and private 10040 entries; onboarding offers both, public by default. |
| D7 | Don't store `reporters` / `muters`. |
| D18 push | Apply Curated filtering to push notifications; this is why the index must load fast (D3, D11). |
| D18 replies | Collapse replies from outside the network. |
| D15e | Accept any NIP-85 provider. Manual setup for any; guided sign-up via per-provider adapters, since provider account creation isn't specified. Brainstorm first. |

Still open: D6a (memoize prefixes on `User`), D9b (resuming a cold sync), D9c (network
policy), D18 public chats. Phase 0 measurements should settle the first three.

## 7. Implementation notes (2026-10-07)

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| Index, builder, codec | `quartz/.../nip85TrustedAssertions/users/index/TrustNetwork{Index,Builder,Codec}.kt` (11 unit tests) |
| Sync (cold / update / full check) | `.../users/index/TrustNetworkSync.kt`; live run in `WotNetworkIndexBenchmark.productionSync`: 151k cards in 6.5 s cold, 1.2 s update, 2.9 s full check |
| Per-account state | `commons/.../wot/network/TrustNetworkState.kt`, owned by `Account.trustNetwork`; files in `accounts/<pubkey>/wot/` |
| Verdict | `Account.trustNetworkVerdict` / `isOutsideTrustNetwork` / `isKnownChatroom` |
| Minimum score | `AccountSyncedSettings.security.minTrustScore` (synced, default 5) |
| Consumers | DM Known/New filters + DM push (`isKnownChatroom`); Curated notifications in-app (`NotificationFeedFilter`) and push (`EventNotificationConsumer`); collapsed out-of-network replies (`ThreadFeedView`); rank/follower badges from the index (`UserCardsCache`), which also drops the per-profile provider subscription |
| Onboarding | `commons/.../wot/onboarding/` (`TrustProviderOnboarding`, `BrainstormOnboarding`, OkHttp transport) |
| Settings screen | `commonsUI/.../settings/wot/WebOfTrustScreen.kt` (`Route.WebOfTrust`, in Settings › Account), render-tested in both themes |
| Android | dedicated sync client + metered check (`AppModules`/`AccountCacheState`), foreground trigger, daily `TrustNetworkSyncWorker` |

Behaviours added during implementation:
- A cold download that returns **zero cards** does not activate filtering (a provider still
  computing a new user's scores has published nothing yet); the screen says so and retries.
- The index on disk is used **before** the 10040 resolves at startup (5 s grace), so a push that
  wakes the process is filtered.
- The full check re-fetches the provider's rank-0 cards each time (they are dropped from the
  index, so negentropy sees them as missing). Brainstorm had 678 for the test account: a few
  hundred KB a week.

Not done: `amy wot` commands, public-chat filtering (open), Desktop wiring (its `DesktopIAccount`
does not use the commons `Account` yet), and the phone measurements for phase 0.
