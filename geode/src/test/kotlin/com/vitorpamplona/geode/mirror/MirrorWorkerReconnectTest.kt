/**
 * The mirror is a long-running daemon, so surviving its upstream is not
 * optional. This drives the REAL production transport (OkHttp WebSocket
 * against a real Ktor port — no in-process shortcut): the upstream is
 * stopped mid-mirror and a new instance is brought up on the same port.
 * The worker must ride through the disconnect (NostrClient's backoff +
 * keep-alive own the re-dial), re-send its REQ, drop the replayed
 * duplicate, and pull the event that only exists on the new instance.
 *
 * Timing note: after a stable connection drops, the client's backoff is
 * reset to 1s and re-dial attempts double from there. The worker's 5s
 * retry pump nudges the pool well ahead of NostrClient's own 60s
 * keep-alive (without it, this test measured a 61s blackout when the
 * immediate re-dial raced the port rebind; with it, ~6s). The generous
 * timeout only covers a worst-case scheduling stall on a loaded CI
 * runner.
