/**
 * Why a soft-banned member cannot delete a Concord community's history from the relay — and what
 * keeps it that way.
 *
 * The worry is real. CORD-01 inverts NIP-59: every wrap on a plane is signed by the *shared stream
 * key*, not by its author, and the true author only exists inside the encrypted seal. A member
 * banned yesterday still derives `group_key("concord/channel", community_root, channel_id, epoch)`
 * from the root they kept, so they can still sign events *as the channel itself*. If NIP-09 and
 * NIP-62 authorized on the outer `pubkey`, [Nip09DeletionTest]'s "a kind-5 from pubkey X cannot
 * delete pubkey Y's events" would be vacuous inside a plane: one event from any ex-member would
 * erase the whole community's history.
 *
 * What stops it is [com.vitorpamplona.quartz.nip01Core.store.owner]: a kind-1059 gift wrap is
 * controlled by its **p-tag recipient**, not its signer. Concord stamps a *freshly random* p-tag on
 * every wrap ([ConcordStreamEnvelope.wrapSeal]), so each wrap is owned by a one-time key that
 * nobody — attacker, author, or owner — ever holds. The channel is undeletable by construction.
 *
 * Both halves of that are load-bearing and neither was written for this reason, so both are pinned
 * here: [theEphemeralPTagIsWhatMakesTheChannelUndeletable] fails the moment the p-tag becomes a
 * real key, and the first two tests fail the moment ownership goes back to the signer.
 *
 * **Scope.** This is our relay's rule, not the protocol's. A community publishes wherever its
 * metadata points, and a third-party relay that reads NIP-09 the naive way — deletion authorized by
 * matching `pubkey` — hands every ex-member a wipe button for the whole channel. The protocol-level
 * fix is the same one that already exists for everything else: a CORD-06 Refounding rotates the
 * plane address, which protects the future but cannot restore what a relay already dropped.
