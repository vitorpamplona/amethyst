/**
 * Cost of the deletion side-channel ([negentropySettleDeletions]) at database scale.
 *
 * The whole point of the two-pass design is that turning deletions on does NOT re-fetch
 * content — the content sync already downloaded the need set, and the settle only touches
 * the reconcile *residual* (the events a deletion stopped from converging). So its cost is
 * one reconcile per round plus the residual, independent of how big the database is.
 *
 * This models the post-content-settle state: a relay holding N notes, and a local store
 * holding the same N notes EXCEPT K it deleted (it keeps the K kind-5s). The residual is
 * exactly those K — so a `sendUp` settle fetches K, not N. It prints the reconcile cost
 * (the O(N) part it shares with any sync) next to the settle cost, so the deletion
 * overhead is visible as "≈ a couple of reconciles + K", not "+ a content re-download".
 *
 * Why the printed settle can read as several× a bare reconcile at large N: the extra time
 * is NOT the deletion algorithm (a phase breakdown showed reconciles stay ~sub-second at
 * N=100k, and the settle re-fetches K=20, not N). It is entirely the K `publishAndConfirm`
 * ingests into a large geode relay — publishing K *plain* notes costs the same — and that
 * ingest path is JVM-cold on first use: consecutive K-note batches dropped monotonically
 * (~3100 → ~570 ms) purely from JIT warmup. So the cost is O(K) relay-ingest dominated by
 * one-time warmup, independent of N.
 *
 * Default N is small so it doubles as a fast correctness guard; scale it with
 * `-DdelBenchN=200000` to see the shape at size. Not a speed assertion (container noise).
