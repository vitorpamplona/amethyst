/**
 * Per-WebSocket pump that owns the bounded outbound queue and the
 * writer coroutine. Pulled out of `KtorRelay` so that file
 * stays focused on Ktor wiring; the slow-client / backpressure
 * policy now lives next to the data structures it manages.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. `connect(server, registerSession)` opens a [RelaySession],
 *      registers it with the supplied callback, and starts the
 *      writer coroutine that drains [outQueue] into [outgoing].
 *   2. `pump()` reads inbound frames until the socket closes.
 *   3. `finally`-style teardown closes the queue, cancels the
 *      writer, unregisters the session, and closes it.
 *
 * Slow-client policy: once the outbound backlog reaches
 * [MAX_OUTGOING_BUFFER] frames, the connection is dropped rather
 * than silently losing EVENT/EOSE — silent drop would corrupt
 * NIP-01.
 *
 * Memory model: the outbound queue is `Channel.UNLIMITED`, which in
 * kotlinx.coroutines allocates segments lazily — an idle connection
 * pays only a small head-segment cost. The cap is enforced via
 * [outstanding] rather than the channel's own capacity so we don't
 * reserve a fixed-size buffer up-front for every connection. At
 * 5 000+ idle connections this matters: an 8 192-slot fixed buffer
 * per connection would otherwise dominate JVM heap usage even
 * though the vast majority of connections never fan out.
