/**
 * Strict boot-time check for a `[[mirror]].filter` JSON string. The
 * NIP-01 [com.vitorpamplona.quartz.nip01Core.relay.filters.Filter]
 * deserializer is tolerant by design — it skips unknown keys and drops
 * wrong-typed entries — which is right for untrusted wire input but
 * wrong for operator config: a typo like `{"kindss":[4]}` would silently
 * parse to an empty (match-everything) filter. Because this filter is
 * the containment boundary for a `trusted = true` upstream (it caps what
 * a skip-verify upstream may inject), a silent mis-parse would widen
 * that trust to the whole firehose. So we reject the obvious mistakes at
 * boot instead of degrading the boundary.
