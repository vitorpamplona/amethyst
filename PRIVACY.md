# Amethyst Privacy Policy & Terms of Use

Effective as of Jan 20, 2023 for the distributed applications in the Play Store and the F-Droid Catalogue 

The Amethyst app for Android does not collect or process any personal information from its users. The app is used to connect to third-party Nostr servers (also called Relays) that may or may not collect personal information and are not covered by this privacy policy. Each third-party relay server comes equipped with its own privacy policy and terms of use that can be viewed through the app or through that server's website. The developers of this open source project or maintainers of the distribution channels (app stores) do not have access to the data located in the user's phone. Accounts are fully maintained by the user. We do not have control over them. 

The app may collect a per-device token, your public key and a preferred Relay to connect to and provide push notification services through Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging. Other than that, the data from connected accounts is only stored locally on the device when it is required for functionality and performance of Amethyst. This data is strictly confidental and cannot be accessed by other apps (on non-rooted devices). Phone data can be deleted by clearing Amethyst's local storage or uninstalling the app.

You cannot use the Amethyst app for Android to submit Objectionable Content to relays. Objectionable Content includes, but is not limited to: (i) sexually explicit materials; (ii) obscene, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, violent and/or unlawful content or profanity; (iii) content that infringes upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other personal or proprietary right, or that is deceptive or fraudulent; (iv) content that promotes the use or sale of illegal or regulated substances, tobacco products, ammunition and/or firearms; and (v) illegal content related to gambling.

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the app after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.

If you have any questions about Amethyst or this privacy policy, you can send a message to amethyst@vitorpamplona.com
