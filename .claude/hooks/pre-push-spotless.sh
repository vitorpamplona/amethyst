# Fires on `git push` (Bash tool) and on the create_pull_request MCP tool. Runs
# `spotlessApply`; if that reformats any tracked .kt/.kts file, the push/PR is
# blocked (exit 2) so the agent commits the formatting fix first. This turns
# CI's `spotlessCheck` failure into an in-session block — no red PR, no round
# trip. `spotlessApply` runs the same formatters CI's `spotlessCheck` verifies,
# so a clean apply means a green check.
