"""Fail if the Compose resource catalog carries Android-only string escaping.

Android's aapt and Compose Multiplatform do not share escaping rules. Compose
(compose-gradle-plugin `handleSpecialCharacters`) resolves only \\uXXXX, \\n and
\\t, and collapses \\\\. It leaves \\' \\" \\? \\@ alone and renders Android's
quote-wrapping literally, so a value carried verbatim out of `res/values/` ships
a visible backslash: the login screen once read `Don\\'t have a Nostr account?`.

`tools:` attributes are the same class of mistake. They are an Android-lint
construct whose namespace is declared on the Android `<resources>` root; Compose
catalog roots do not declare it, so the prefix is unbound and the XML malformed.

**This recurs on every Crowdin sync.** Crowdin holds the Android-escaped source,
so each import reintroduces it -- twice in two days, 2,068 escaped apostrophes
across 40 locales each time, always the apostrophe-heavy regional variants
(uz-rUZ, fr-rFR, fr-rCA, tr-rTR). Like the orphan-strings desync, it arrives
through a bot-authored PR with no local session in the path, so CI is the layer
that has to catch it.

Repair with:

    python3 tools/strings-migrate/fix_escapes.py --no-unwrap-quotes \\
        commons/src/commonMain/composeResources

`--no-unwrap-quotes` is mandatory on already-migrated files: escape conversion is
idempotent, quote-unwrapping is not, and a second unwrap strips the real display
quotes from values like `import_follows_tips`.

Only the Compose catalog is scanned. In an Android res tree the same escaping is
correct and must be left alone.
