 * Three sources spell the same language differently. Language identification emits a mix of old
 * and new ISO 639 codes (`iw` for Hebrew, but `id` for Indonesian, `no` for Norwegian, `fil` for
 * Filipino). The "Don't translate from" and "Translate to" settings hold `Locale.language`, which
 * gives the old codes (`iw`, `in`) or the new ones (`he`, `id`) depending on the runtime, and `nb`
 * for a Norwegian Bokmål device. The translator accepts `iw`, `in` and `nb` as aliases. So a raw
 * string comparison let a blocked language through to the model download.
