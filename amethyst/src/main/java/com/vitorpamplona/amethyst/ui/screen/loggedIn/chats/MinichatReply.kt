/**
 * Whether [event] is a **minichat thread reply** — a reply that lives inside the thread opened from
 * its parent message, NOT as a flat sibling in the main timeline. Three dialects express the same idea:
 *
 * - **NIP-28/NIP-29 (public chats, Concord)**: a kind-1111 [CommentEvent].
 * - **Buzz workspaces, current**: a kind-9 [ChatEvent] carrying a NIP-10 `reply`-marked `e` tag. This
 *   is what every live Buzz client writes — `_buildReplyTags` in its Flutter client emits
 *   `["e", id, "", "reply"]` for a direct reply and `["e", root, "", "root"]` +
 *   `["e", parent, "", "reply"]` for a nested one, and all three of their clients send chat as kind 9.
 * - **Buzz workspaces, legacy**: a kind-40002 [StreamMessageV2Event] with the same markers and NOT
 *   flagged `broadcast`. Nothing in Buzz writes 40002 any more (their own NOSTR.md grades it
 *   "Buzz-only — no standard NIP-29 client renders these"), but events exist in the wild from the
 *   10002 -> 40001 -> 40002 migration, and Amethyst itself wrote some, so it stays readable.
 *
 * ### Why a marked `e` and not `q`
 *
 * NIP-C7 gives kind 9 exactly one reply mechanism — `["q", <id>, <relay>, <pubkey>]` — and never
 * mentions `e` at all. So a marked `e` carries no C7 meaning and is free to denote a *thread* reply,
 * which is precisely how Buzz uses it. The marker is what separates the cases: WhiteNoise/Marmot
 * thread kind-9 chat with a **plain, unmarked** `e`, which is an in-chat reply and must keep rendering
 * as a quote bubble in the timeline — so matching on the `reply` marker (never on the bare tag) leaves
 * that dialect untouched.
 *
 * A `broadcast=1` reply is an inline timeline sibling ("also send to channel"), matching block/buzz's
 * `isThreadReply`. Kind 9 has no broadcast tag, so a marked kind-9 is always thread-only.
 *
 * The timeline filter drops these (they belong in the minichat), the minichat count counts them, and
 * the minichat feed shows them — so all three agree on one definition.
