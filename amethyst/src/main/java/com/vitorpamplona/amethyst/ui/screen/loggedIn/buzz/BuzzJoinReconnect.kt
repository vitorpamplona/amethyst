/**
 * Re-dials the whole relay pool after a Buzz workspace join.
 *
 * NIP-42 sends its AUTH challenge once, on connect. If the socket was already open
 * before the join (the common case — the relay is in the user's lists and connected
 * at startup), that challenge was spent while the relay was still NOT first-party,
 * so the connection is unauthenticated and every `#p=me`-gated read on it is
 * refused. Joining makes the relay first-party (see `AuthCoordinator.isFirstParty`);
 * this forces the relay to re-challenge so the connection authenticates.
 *
 * Shared by the three join sites that need the re-challenge, both to keep the
 * reconnect flags identical and to give the churn ledger one place to attribute from:
 * without the counter, `Σ(relay.trigger.*)` would only account for the
 * connectivity-driven teardowns `RelayProxyClientConnector` reports, and a full pool
 * teardown is the most expensive thing either can do.
 *
 * `BuzzInviteScreen` is a fourth join+pre-approve site that deliberately does NOT
 * reconnect — it hands off to the in-app browser rather than reading a `#p=me`-gated
 * subscription — so `relay.trigger.buzz` undercounts joins, not re-challenges.
