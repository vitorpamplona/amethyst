/**
 * Crawls *every* known relay for the user's NIP-60 wallet events.
 *
 * NIP-60 wallets (kind:17375) are portable across clients and replaceable, so a
 * user who created one in another app (cashu.me, Boardwalk, …) may have a valid
 * wallet sitting on relays Amethyst's own subscription never reads. Before the
 * "create a new wallet" path can clobber it, the find-my-wallet wizard runs this
 * discovery to pull in *all* distinct kind:17375 (and kind:10019 nutzap-config)
 * events authored by the account.
 *
 * Modeled on
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.loggedIn.relays.eventsync.EventSync]:
 *  - queries up to [MAX_CONCURRENT_RELAYS] relays concurrently via a sliding
 *    [Semaphore] window inside a [supervisorScope];
 *  - paginates each relay individually through Quartz's [fetchAllPages];
 *  - runs on a **fresh** [INostrClient] (built by [clientBuilder]) so the crawled
 *    events never pollute the production [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.LocalCache].
 *
 * Unlike EventSync this neither republishes nor mutates state — it only collects
 * and hands the distinct events back to the wizard for parsing/verification.
