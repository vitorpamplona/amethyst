/**
 * Keeps Nostr mentions atomic against IME edits that would only modify part of
 * the underlying bech32 (notably Microsoft SwiftKey, which re-enters word-edit
 * mode over a previously-committed display token and rewrites a single word of
 * a multi-word `@DisplayName`, leaving an orphan tail of the npub that no
 * longer matches the mention regex).
 *
 * Three change shapes are blocked and routed to atomic-collapse:
 *  - Partial overlap (the change's `originalRange` overlaps a mention but does
 *    not fully cover it).
 *  - Scope-exact replace (the change's `originalRange` matches the mention's
 *    range exactly and the replacement is non-empty — covers IMEs that
 *    fully-cover-replace a multi-word display token with one of its words).
 *
 * Anything else passes through:
 *  - Pure delete that fully covers a mention (the user removed the chip).
 *  - A change whose range covers more than just the mention (select-all + type,
 *    select-paragraph + paste, etc.) — treated as deliberate broader edit.
