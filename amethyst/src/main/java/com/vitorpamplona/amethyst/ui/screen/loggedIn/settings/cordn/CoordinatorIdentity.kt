/**
 * What to call a coordinator, and the face to put next to it.
 *
 * A coordinator is a Nostr identity -- ContextVM addresses it with ordinary
 * p-tags, and CEP-23 says outright that a server MAY publish NIP-01 profile
 * metadata (`CvmKinds.PROFILE_METADATA` is kind 0 for exactly this reason). So
 * the app can name one the same way it names anybody else, and showing 64 hex
 * characters instead was throwing that away.
 *
 * ## The order, and why
 *
 * 1. `CoordinatorConfig.label` -- documented as "what the user calls it. Never
 *    a claim -- a coordinator cannot prove a name." The only name here that
 *    means anything, so it wins.
 * 2. The CEP-6 announcement's name, when the cache holds one. Before the
 *    profile because a coordinator added from discovery was *picked* by this
 *    name, and having the settings screen rename it afterwards would be its own
 *    small confusion.
 * 3. The kind 0's display name (CEP-23).
 * 4. The key's first characters.
 *
 * Both 2 and 3 are the coordinator's own word for itself, and two servers may
 * publish the same one, which is why neither outranks a label.
 *
 * The profile is observed whatever the outcome, so the avatar still loads for a
 * coordinator that is named by 1 or 2.

 *
 * [name] is a `RowScope` slot so a caller can weight it, which both of them
 * need; before it was, they weighted it anyway and compiled only because

 * own slot for the same reason: an action smuggled through a slot called `name`
