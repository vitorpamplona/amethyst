 * Applies the surrounding [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.layouts.DisappearingScaffold]'s reserved
 * top/bottom space as padding. The scaffold places content at y=0 by design — it lets feeds
 * scroll *behind* the disappearing bar — but the month/week/day views are static-headered grids,
 * so without this modifier the grid header would render under the top app bar. Outside a
 * scaffold the local default is zero and the modifier is a no-op.
