/**
 * Drives the notifications feed's infinite-scroll backward pagination over the account's per-relay
 * [AccountNotificationsHistoryEoseManager] (a [BackwardRelayPager][com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.relayClient.paging.BackwardRelayPager]:
 * each relay keeps its own until+limit cursor so faulty relays with different datasets page independently
 * and can't gap each other) and returns the per-relay [RelayReachCursor]s the feed draws as frontier
 * markers.
 *
 * Three cooperating drivers, all gated on [drivesPaging] so only the on-screen feed pages the shared
 * account pager (an off-screen split tab / second pane stays idle):
 *  1. **Look-ahead buffer** — keeps a fat runway of older notifications loaded ahead of the viewport, so
 *     healthy relays fill the feed and the user practically never reaches the end. Bounded per burst
 *     ([NOTIFICATION_MAX_PAGES_PER_BURST]) and reset by scrolling, so a dense account whose events collapse
 *     into few cards can't burst-download its whole history to hit the row target, while a normal account
 *     still preloads the full look-ahead from the top.
 *  2. **Auto-retry** — when every relay is done-or-stalled (exhausted) but some are merely stalled (a
 *     slow/unreachable relay, not a real end), re-advances them on a backoff so recovery doesn't depend on
 *     the user scrolling to the marker or reopening.
 *  3. **Per-relay sentinels** — retry an individual relay the moment its frontier marker scrolls into view;
 *     the buffer keeps the frontier below the fold, so these stay quiet unless the buffer can't keep up.
 *
 * @param createdAtAt createdAt of the card at a LazyColumn index (null past the ends / non-card rows), so
 *   the hoisted sentinel can test which inter-card gap a relay's cursor sits in against the visible rows.
