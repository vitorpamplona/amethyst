/**
 * A small pill showing an unread-message [count] (new messages since this account last read).
 * Renders nothing when [count] is zero, so callers can place it unconditionally. Capped at
 * [CHAT_UNREAD_CAP]+ and carries a plural content description for screen readers.
 *
 * The pill itself is [ChatUnreadBadge], shared with the other chat lists; this
 * wrapper only supplies Concord's own plural so the two surfaces cannot drift
 * apart visually.
