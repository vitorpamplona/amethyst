/**
 * Always-on account-level preload of every joined community's Control (and folded Chat) planes,

 * — the Concord analog of the always-on account/DM gift-wrap tail
 * ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.relayClient.reqCommand.account.AccountFilterAssemblerSubscription]).
 *
 * Concord control-plane wraps are addressed to *derived stream keys*, not `#p=self`, so the always-on
 * DM tail never picks them up — without this, communities only fold (and thus reveal their channels,
 * metadata/icon and membership) while a Concord screen happens to be open. Uses the non-lifecycle
 * [KeyDataSourceSubscription] so the planes stay requested app-wide, exactly like DMs, and keeps the
 * same [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.model.concord.ConcordSessionManager.revision] watch so a
 * fresh fold subscribes its newly-revealed channel planes.
 *
 * Preloading a community's planes requires its keys, which come from the private kind-13302 list —
 * so a community pinned to the bottom bar whose list never reached the cache preloads nothing and
 * shows a blank tab + server screen ("doesn't load at all"). That list often lives only on the
 * community's own relays (Armada/Vector publish it there, never to the user's outbox), so before we
 * can preload we may first have to fetch it: [bootstrapPinnedCommunities] imports the list for any
 * pinned community we don't yet know, from the relays saved on its tab. Once it folds into the cache,
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.model.concord.ConcordChannelListState.liveCommunities] surfaces
 * the entry, the tab/screen fill in, and the plane preload above picks it up.

/**
 * Account-wide COMPLETE-mode sync of every joined community's Control Plane — the completeness pass
 * that pairs with the always-on live subscription. The live plane subscription
 * ([ConcordChannelFilterAssembler]) carries brand-new editions in real time, but it advances a
 * `since` cursor and rides the relay's per-filter cap, so it can miss an edition below the high-water
 * mark or a cropped initial page — either of which folds a partial channel list / stale roster.
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.Account.syncConcordControlPlanes] closes both by re-fetching the
 * whole plane with no `since`, paging past the cap.
 *
 * It fires only on the **events** that can create a gap — never on a wall-clock poll, because a
 * persistent live subscription already keeps a connected relay complete:
 *  1. **Load / membership / held-epoch change** — keyed on a signature of the joined set + held
 *     epochs (the moments a new Control-Plane address appears: join/leave, Refounding). NOT the fold
 *     revision — a revision-keyed sweep would loop (drain → ingest → fold → revision → drain).
 *  2. **Reconnect** — a relay hosting a joined community that comes back online may have missed
 *     editions published while it was down; that gap is exactly what the live sub can't backfill. We
 *     re-sweep when the connected-relay set *gains* one of our relays, coalescing flaps with a min
 *     interval.
