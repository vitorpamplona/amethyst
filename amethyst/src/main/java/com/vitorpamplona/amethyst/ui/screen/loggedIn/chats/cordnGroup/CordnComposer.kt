/**
 * The cordn room's composer, on the same field every other Amethyst chat uses.
 *
 * [ThinPaddingTextField] + [ThinSendButton] inside [EditFieldModifier], with the shared
 * mention machinery on top: [ShowUserSuggestionList] for `@` autocomplete,
 * [MentionPreservingInputTransformation] so an IME cannot rewrite half a bech32, and
 * [UrlUserTagOutputTransformation] so a pasted or completed mention reads as a name
 * while you type it. Before this the room had a bare `OutlinedTextField` over a
 * `String`: cordn could *render* mentions and highlight a message that named you, but
 * the only way to enter one was to type `nostr:npub1…` by hand.
 *
 * Mentions are inserted as resolved `nostr:` URIs (`forceNostrUri`). See the parameter's
 * KDoc — cordn has no send-time tagger, so the short `@npub1…` form would ship as text.
 *
 * Looking users up to offer them is the same safe direction as everywhere else on this
 * screen: profiles are public relay data the cache already holds, and reading one puts
 * no part of this conversation into it.
