/**
 * One slot in the bottom navigation bar. A single ordered list of these (persisted per-account in
 * the NIP-78 app-specific data event via
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.AccountNavigationPreferencesInternal.bottomBarItems]) holds
 * built-in destinations, favorite apps, and individual joined chats/groups, so the user can pin and
 * drag-reorder them together in one list.
 *
 * - [BuiltIn] resolves its [Route][com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.navigation.routes.Route] (and its
 *   icon/label/notification badge) through [NavBarCatalog], like before.
 * - [Favorite] points at a [FavoriteApp][com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.favorites.FavoriteApp] by
 *   its stable id (which already encodes the route's parameters — the `url` or addressable
 *   `coordinate`); the bar resolves it to a live favorite for its icon/label and to
 *   `Route.WebApp` / `Route.NostrApp` for navigation.
 * - [PublicChat], [RelayGroup] and [Concord] each pin one specific joined chat the user picked from
 *   their joined list (NIP-28 channel, NIP-29 relay group, or a Concord community). The bar resolves
 *   each to the chat's avatar + name from the local cache and to its chat/home route for navigation.
 * - [RelayServer] and [ConcordChannel] pin the *other* level of the two grouped chat systems: a NIP-29
 *   host relay (whose home page lists every group on it) and one channel inside a Concord community.
 *   A NIP-29 relay is the analog of a Concord community (the container), and a Concord channel is the
 *   analog of a NIP-29 group (the item) — so together the five group entries let the user pin either
 *   the whole server or a single room in both systems.
