 * Recent chat of **one** joined group: a single-valued `#h` filter on its host relay, bounded by a shared

 * reconnect re-issues one `since=window` REQ, never a page replay).
 *
 * ### Why one group per filter — and per *subscription*
 *
 * This used to batch every joined group on a relay into ONE filter carrying every group id in `#h`. That
 * shape is valid NIP-01 (a multi-value tag filter is an OR), and relays serve it correctly for **stored**
 * queries — which is exactly what made the bug so confusing: the boot backfill populated every group, so
 * the Messages list looked right until it needed to update.
 *
 * But `block/buzz` (the relay behind `*.communities.buzz.xyz`) indexes each live subscription under a
 * *single* channel uuid, resolved from the filters' `#h`. When two or more distinct ids appear anywhere
 * across a subscription's filters, `extract_channel_id_from_filters` returns `None` and the subscription
 * is registered as **global** — and global subscriptions deliberately never receive channel-scoped events
 * (`fan_out_scoped`: "Global subscriptions do NOT receive channel-scoped events", guarding against leaking
 * private channel content to a subscriber whose membership wasn't checked per channel). Net effect: a
 * batched tail gets full history at EOSE and then goes permanently deaf, so the Messages row froze while
 * the open chat — which always used a single-valued `#h` — stayed live.
 *
 * The resolution scans **all filters of a subscription**, so splitting into one filter per group is not
 * enough: each group needs its **own subscription** (see [RelayGroupJoinedChatTailFilterAssembler], which
 * keys its EOSE manager on [GroupId]). Relays advertise room for this — buzz allows `max_subscriptions:
 * 1024` against `max_filters: 10` — and it sidesteps the filter cap for anyone in more than ten groups.

 * A NIP-29 channel is roster-driven (kind 10009), so it needs one newest message per row, not a window.
