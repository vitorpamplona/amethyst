 * Entry for a Simple Nostr Object (DECK-0003 kind 33331).
 *
 * The geometry travels in the event's content, so the object itself is drawn
 * from what the note already carries. The one thing that can be elsewhere is
 * its palette: §1.3a lets `colors` index a palette another event holds, and
 * [WithSnoPalette] fetches that one. Until it arrives the object is drawn
 * against the built-in, which is what §1.3b says an unresolved reference means.
 *
 * A payload that fails §1.9 is not drawn — the deck requires that — and the
 * rule it broke is shown instead of nothing.
