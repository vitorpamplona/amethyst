/**
 * Scroll-linked connection that hides/reveals the top and bottom bars together.
 *
 * Philosophy: the bars never consume scroll input. They simply ride along with the
 * content — their offset changes at the same rate as the scroll, so the user keeps full
 * control of the list with their finger. This mirrors the behaviour of Twitter, Instagram,
 * Bluesky, etc., where content scrolling is never delayed by the chrome.
 *
 *  - onPostScroll reads `consumed.y + available.y` (the total scroll attempt that entered
 *    the nested-scroll chain) and updates the bar offsets. Using the sum means the bars
 *    also respond to overscroll attempts at the list edges.
 *  - Pure overscroll (`consumed.y == 0`) from the fully-visible state is ignored. This
 *    prevents short, non-scrollable lists from hiding the bars purely on an overscroll
 *    gesture — which would leave blank padding at the top and bottom. Once the bars have
 *    started moving (list is clearly scrollable), edge overscroll keeps affecting them.
 *  - onPostFling snaps a mid-way bar to the nearest edge, using the fling's remaining
 *    velocity as the spring's initial velocity so the settle feels continuous. No velocity
 *    is returned upward to avoid phantom scrolls on parent containers.
