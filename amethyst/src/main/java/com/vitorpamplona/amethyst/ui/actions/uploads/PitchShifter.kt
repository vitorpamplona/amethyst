/**
 * Pure-Kotlin pitch shifter for mono float PCM.
 *
 * Shifts pitch by a frequency [ratio][shift] while preserving the original
 * duration, by combining two textbook DSP steps:
 *
 * 1. **WSOLA time-stretch** (Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add) stretches the
 *    signal in time by the pitch ratio without changing its pitch. Unlike plain
 *    overlap-add, WSOLA searches a small window around each analysis frame for
 *    the offset that best correlates with the natural continuation of the
 *    previous frame, which avoids the phase-discontinuity "warble" of OLA.
 * 2. **Linear resampling** back to the original length raises (or lowers) the
 *    pitch by the same ratio and restores the duration.
 *
 * This is a clean-room implementation of the standard WSOLA algorithm; it
 * carries no third-party code and keeps the app free of GPL-licensed DSP
 * dependencies. Quality is more than sufficient for voice anonymization, whose
 * pitch factors are modest (~0.7x–1.5x).
