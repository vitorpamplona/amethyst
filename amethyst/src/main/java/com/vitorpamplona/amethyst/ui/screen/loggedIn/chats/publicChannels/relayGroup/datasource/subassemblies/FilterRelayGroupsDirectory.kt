/**
 * A group's kind-39000 is relay-signed, so — unlike git repositories, whose author IS a follow —
 * the people dimension (relay-key follow / follow-is-admin / follow-is-member) can't be expressed
 * as an `authors` REQ. For Global and the people filters we therefore pull the whole directory
 * (metadata + rosters) for each relay in the resolved set and let
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.loggedIn.chats.publicChannels.relayGroup.dal.RelayGroupDiscoveryFeedFilter]
 * narrow it locally. Only the topic/geo filters ([filterRelayGroupsByHashtag]/[filterRelayGroupsByGeohashes])
 * carry a real relay-side constraint.
