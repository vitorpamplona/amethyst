/**
 * Decides when an embedded tab rebuilds itself after its sandbox-side surface died underneath it.
 *
 * Every WebView in `:napplet` shares one renderer process. When the OS reclaims it (memory pressure after
 * a long session, the app sitting in the background) or it crashes, EVERY warm tab loses its WebView at
 * once, and a surface whose remote session errored out paints nothing — both leave a black rectangle that
 * never comes back on its own. The tab was already loaded, so no load overlay covers it either.
 *
 * Recovery is automatic but lazy: the visible tab rebuilds right away, a parked one only when it is next
 * shown, so a renderer death doesn't rebuild every warm tab at once and push memory straight back up. A
 * page that kills its renderer again right after an automatic rebuild is not rebuilt in a loop — the tab
 * falls back to the error overlay and its Retry.
 *
 * Main-thread only. [now] is injectable for tests.
