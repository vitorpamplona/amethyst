/**
 * Bridges the shell-level [AppNavigationRail] to the per-screen re-tap behaviors that live in
 * each screen's [AppBottomBar] onClick lambda (scroll-to-top, feed refresh, ...).
 *
 * On phones the bottom bar invokes the screen's lambda directly. On large screens the bar
 * renders nothing, but it still registers the screen's lambda here; when the user taps the
 * rail item that is already selected, the rail routes the tap back through [reselect] so the
 * exact same per-screen logic runs.
