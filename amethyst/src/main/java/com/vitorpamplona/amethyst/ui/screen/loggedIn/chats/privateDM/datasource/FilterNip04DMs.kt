/**
 * Where a conversation's NIP-04 DMs flow, resolved via the outbox model and **scoped per relay** so
 * every filter only names the keys that actually own the relay it is sent to.
 *
 * Each map is `relay -> the counterpart keys to name in that relay's filter`:
 *  - [toMeRelays] queries messages **to me** (`authors=[those keys], #p=[me]`). A relay appears here
 *    when it is my inbox (then the key set is the whole group) and/or a counterpart's outbox (then
 *    the key set is just the counterparts who publish there).
 *  - [fromMeRelays] queries messages **from me** (`authors=[me], #p=[those keys]`). A relay appears
 *    here when it is my outbox (then the key set is the whole group) and/or a counterpart's inbox
 *    (then the key set is just the counterparts who read there).
 *
 * Scoping the key set per relay is what keeps us from sending, e.g., `authors=[bob]` to a relay that
 * is only charlie's — a filter that relay has no reason to serve.
