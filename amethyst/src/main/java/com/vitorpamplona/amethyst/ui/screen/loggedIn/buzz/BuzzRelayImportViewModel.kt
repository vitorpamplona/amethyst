/**
 * Discovers the Buzz workspace channels the user already belongs to on a relay (joined via the
 * Buzz web/desktop app) so they can add them to Amethyst. Hosted by the relay group-list screen,
 * which folds this membership-scoped section in when the relay is a Buzz relay.
 *
 * Buzz membership is server-side (no NIP-29 kind-10009 join event), so a Buzz relay exposes no
 * public group directory — the generic "browse a relay" flow returns nothing. Instead the relay
 * addresses each member a kind-44100 member-added notification (`#p` = me). This warm-authenticates
 * the relay (NIP-42) and reads those, then fetches each channel's kind-39000 metadata to keep only
 * the **non-DM** workspace channels (DMs surface separately). Adding one calls [Account.follow] to
 * append it to the user's kind-10009 list — which makes it appear in the Messages list and load at
 * boot through the existing relay-group machinery, no separate registry needed.
