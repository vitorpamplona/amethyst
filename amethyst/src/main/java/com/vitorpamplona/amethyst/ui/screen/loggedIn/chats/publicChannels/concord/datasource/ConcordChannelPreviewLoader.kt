/**
 * One-shot warm of the last-message preview of **every channel in one community** when its screen is
 * open, so the channel list fills in without the user tapping into each channel.
 *
 * Not a live subscription: it drains one `limit:1` REQ per channel once (the wraps ingest through the
 * normal cache path and the always-on plane subscription keeps them fresh afterward — see
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.Account.warmConcordChannelPreviews]). It re-runs when a fold
 * changes the channel set, debounced so the cold-boot burst of fold revisions coalesces into one warm.
