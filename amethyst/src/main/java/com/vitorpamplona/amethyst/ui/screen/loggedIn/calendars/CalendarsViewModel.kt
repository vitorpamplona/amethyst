/**
 * Everything the calendar screen is *looking at*: which lens is open, which calendar the feed is

 *
 * Scoped to the screen's `NavBackStackEntry`, so it is built the first time the user opens
 * Calendars and cleared when that entry leaves the back stack — not before. That is the whole
 * point of it being here: this state has to outlive the composition (opening an appointment tears
 * it down and rebuilds it on the way back, and switching lenses disposes the branch the previous
 * lens lived in) without outliving the screen. `rememberSaveable` covers the first case at best
 * and never the second; a process-scoped store covers both but then hangs onto a month the user
 * looked at an hour ago, in another account.
 *
 * Two lifetimes ride along for free, and both are what you'd want: the bottom bar's
 * `popUpTo(Home) { saveState = true }` saves this entry rather than clearing it, so leaving the
 * tab and coming back keeps the lens; and the ViewModel store hangs off the account-scoped owner
 * ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.SetAccountCentricViewModelStore]), so switching accounts
 * drops it with everything else that belongs to the old account.
