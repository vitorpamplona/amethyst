/**
 * Eagerly warms the NIP-11 documents of the host relays of every group the user has joined, in
 * parallel. The NIP-29 relay-signed check ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.nip11RelayInfo.isRelaySignedRelayGroup])
 * reads those docs from cache, so pre-warming them from a primary tab (Messages) means the moment
 * one of these groups also surfaces in discovery — or any relay-signed gate runs — the answer is a
 * cache hit rather than a cold fetch. Cheap: the cache dedups and holds each doc for an hour.
