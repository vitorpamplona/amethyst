/**
 * Backing ViewModel for [BuzzDmListScreen] — the user's Buzz direct-message inbox.
 *
 * A Buzz DM is a relay-authoritative NIP-29 group whose `h`/id is a relay-generated UUID, so the
 * message timeline reuses the whole relay-group chat stack; this ViewModel owns only *discovery*
 * and the inbox projection. Discovery mirrors how the deployed relay actually models DMs (it does
 * NOT emit a queryable kind-41001): the relay addresses each member a kind-44100 member-added
 * notification (`#p` = me, `h` = channel), and marks a channel a DM via the `t` tag on its
 * kind-39000 metadata (with the participants inlined as `p` tags). So it:
 * - fetches + live-subscribes 44100 (`#p` = me) across the joined Buzz relays to learn the
 *   channels the user is in;
 * - fetches each channel's directory (39000-39003) and keeps the ones whose metadata says
 *   `t` = `dm` — that same 39000 also carries the roster the shared chat composer's member gate
 *   needs, and the DM participants;
 * - subscribes the per-viewer [DmVisibilityEvent] (`kind:30622`) so a hidden DM (tracked in
 *   [BuzzDmRegistry]) moves from [rows] to [hiddenRows];
 * - projects the visible DMs into [rows] and the hidden ones into [hiddenRows], both sorted by
 *   last message time. Hidden DMs stay projected (rather than being dropped on the floor) so the
 *   inbox can offer them back — hiding is reversible, and a conversation with no way back is a
 *   conversation the user has lost.
