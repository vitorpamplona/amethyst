/**
 * Process-scoped owner of the bottom-bar warm-up sweep, driven by [EmbeddedTabPreloader].
 *
 * **Why this isn't just a `LaunchedEffect` in the composable.** After an account switch every warm
 * session is torn down ([EmbeddedTabHost.rebuildAll]) and must be rebuilt against the new storage
 * profile — until that happens the tabs have nothing to show. A `LaunchedEffect` dispatches its body
 * through the composition's coroutine scope, and an account switch floods the main thread: the same
 * construct made [EmbeddedTabAccountWatcher] fire 3-4 s late before it became a `SideEffect`. Waiting
 * that long to even *start* the re-warm is what left the tab blank for seconds after a switch.
 *
 * So the **kickoff** is synchronous — [request] is called from a `SideEffect`, in the same apply phase
 * that bumped the epoch — while the sweep itself stays a coroutine, because it genuinely has to suspend
 * (it awaits the network-registry hydration, then retries pending favorites for ~45 s).
 * [CoroutineStart.UNDISPATCHED] on [Dispatchers.Main.immediate] means the body runs *inline* up to its
 * first real suspension, so on a re-warm (registries already hydrated, so `awaitReady` returns without
 * suspending) the first tab is rebuilt before [request] even returns.
