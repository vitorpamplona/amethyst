 * Pins the screen to full brightness, and awake, while a QR code is on it.
 *
 * Half of "this QR code will not scan" is the phone showing it. A dark-mode OLED at the
 * auto-brightness the room asked for can put so little contrast between the black and white
 * modules that the other camera's binarizer cannot separate them — and the person holding it has
 * no idea that is the problem, because to a human eye the code looks perfectly clear.
