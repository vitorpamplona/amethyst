/**
 * State holder for the Side Menu settings screen: owns the set of switched-off drawer rows and the
 * show / hide / restore-default operations, so the composable only renders and forwards events.
 *
 * The rules themselves live in [DrawerItemVisibility] (pure, unit-tested); this adds only the Compose
 * state and the write-through to the account's synced settings. Unlike the bottom bar there is no
 * transient/commit split — a toggle is a single discrete edit, not a drag, so every change persists
 * immediately.
 *
 * No sanitizing here: every value in is either already sanitized by the persistence layer or produced
 * by a [DrawerItemVisibility] operation that can't introduce a mandatory row, and the write side
 * sanitizes again anyway. One authority, not three.
