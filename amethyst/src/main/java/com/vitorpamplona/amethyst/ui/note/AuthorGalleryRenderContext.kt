/**
 * The notification galleries (reactions, zaps, nutzaps, boosts) render up to 30
 * author avatars each. A couple of the inputs to every avatar are *account-global*
 * — the auto-play-gif setting and the logged-in user's follow set — yet the avatar
 * code used to collect each of them **once per author**. With dozens of authors per
 * card that produced dozens of redundant Flow collectors / coroutine launches every
 * time a card scrolled into view, a measurable chunk of the per-card composition cost.
 *
 * Hoisting those reads to a single collection per gallery and handing the snapshot
 * down through [LocalAuthorGalleryRenderContext] lets each avatar read plain values
 * and stay skippable. When the local is absent the avatar falls back to its old
 * per-author behaviour, so callers that don't provide a context keep working.
