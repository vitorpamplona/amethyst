/**
 * Whether the soft keyboard is currently on screen, derived from the IME inset.
 *
 * This intentionally reads the same [SafeImeInsets] that drives `Modifier.imePaddingSafe()`
 * everywhere else in the app, so the two can never disagree about whether the keyboard is up.
 *
 * The original implementation measured `View.getWindowVisibleDisplayFrame` from a
 * `ViewTreeObserver` global-layout listener — a pre-edge-to-edge heuristic. Under
 * `enableEdgeToEdge()` (`decorFitsSystemWindows = false`) the window content no longer resizes for
 * the IME, so that listener fired when the keyboard appeared but frequently never fired again when
 * it closed, latching the state at [Opened] even though the keyboard was gone and leaving the
 * bottom navigation bar hidden behind a stranded gap.
 *
 * Reading `WindowInsets.ime` fixed that, but has a latch of its own: Compose stops updating the
 * inset entirely once its insets listener is left mid-animation, which pins this back at [Opened]
 * in exactly the same way. [SafeImeInsets] is what closes that last hole, which is why this reads
 * the corrected inset rather than the raw one.
