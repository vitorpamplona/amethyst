/**
 * Single source of truth for the host-drawn selection UI over an embedded surface. Folds together what used
 * to be scattered booleans/geometries (`showSelectionToolbar`, `showInsertionHandle`, `fieldGeometry`,
 * `rangeFieldGeometry`, `pageSelection`) so the show/hide rules are expressed in one place.
 *
 * Three mutually-exclusive selection contexts can be active: a bare caret in a field ([insertionGeometry]),
 * a range inside an `<input>`/`<textarea>` ([fieldRange], gated by [fieldHasRange] — the authoritative
 * "is there a selection" signal from the mirror [RemoteImeView]), or a plain page-text selection
 * ([pageSelection]). [dragging] and [scrolling] are the transient modifiers:
 *
 * - **dragging** a handle/caret hides the floating toolbar (and the dragged handle hides itself while the
 *   loupe stands in), matching Android; the other handle stays so you can see the live range.
 * - **scrolling** hides every overlay (its geometry is stale mid-scroll); the shim re-reports geometry on
 *   settle, then clears this, so they reappear in the right place.
