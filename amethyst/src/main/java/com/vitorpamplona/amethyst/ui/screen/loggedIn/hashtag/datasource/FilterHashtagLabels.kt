/**
 * Builds the relay filters that power the NIP-32 side of the hashtag feed:
 *
 * 1. A subscription for kind 1985 label events that tag posts with this hashtag (the `l`
 *    tag under the `#t` namespace), routed through the NIP-65 outbox model: each follow's
 *    labels are requested from THAT follow's outbox relays, with the relay's filter
 *    restricted to the follows that actually write there. This is what guarantees we pick
 *    up a follow's labels even if they never reach the hashtag's own relays.
 * 2. Requests for the underlying posts a *followed* user has labeled but that aren't in
 *    cache yet, so they can actually render in the feed. This rotates as new label
 *    events arrive (the sub-assembler re-runs after each EOSE).
