/**
 * Keeps a reverse-laid-out chat sitting on its newest message.
 *
 * [newest] is whatever identifies the bottom-most row — a note, a message id,
 * anything whose equality changes when a message arrives. In a `reverseLayout`
 * list the newest row is index 0, and a list anchors itself to the row that was
 * already first visible, so without this a sent message lands just below the
 * viewport and the sender never sees it.
 *
 * Someone else's message only pulls the view down when the reader is already at
 * the bottom. A reader who scrolled up into history is deliberately left there:
 * yanking them away because somebody else typed is worse than a missed arrival,
 * which the unread divider covers anyway. Index 1 counts as "at the bottom"
 * because a row that just arrived has already pushed the previous newest up one.
 *
 * [mine] lifts that guard for the reader's own message, and is the whole reason
 * this takes a flag. Sending is an explicit act with an obvious expectation —
 * every chat app puts you on what you just sent — so someone who scrolls up,
 * types and sends must land on it rather than be left reading history with the
 * message they just wrote somewhere off-screen below.
