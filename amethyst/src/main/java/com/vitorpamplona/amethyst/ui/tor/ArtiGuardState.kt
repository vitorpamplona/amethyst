/**
 * Pure, file- and JNI-free parsers over Arti's persisted guard sample
 * (`<filesDir>/arti/state/state/guards.json`).
 *
 * Both recovery heuristics in the Tor stack read the same on-disk file, so the
 * decisions live here where they can be unit-tested against captured fixtures
 * (see `ArtiGuardStateTest`). [TorService] does the file IO and delegates the
 * parsing; [TorManager] consumes [hasConfirmedGuard] to seed its
 * `hasEverBootstrapped` flag across process restarts.
 *
 * The file shape is a map of guard-set selection name (e.g. `"default"`) to an
 * object with a `"guards"` array. Each guard entry carries:
 * - `disabled`: non-null once Arti permanently retires the guard (e.g.
 *   `TooManyIndeterminateFailures` on a flaky network).
 * - `unlisted_since`: non-null once the guard drops out of the consensus.
 * - `confirmed_at`: non-null once the guard has actually been used to build a
 *   circuit — i.e. a real bootstrap reached the guard-confirmation stage.

     * realistically recover from them — every guard permanently `disabled` or dropped from the
     * consensus (`unlisted_since`).
     *
     * This is the AllGuardsDown wedge: Arti can neither build circuits nor replenish the sample, so
     * it stays broken across restarts until the on-disk state is wiped.
     *
     * ### Why this is not `usable == 0`
     *
     * It used to be, on the assumption that "a single usable guard is enough to recover". Observed in
     * the field: a sample of 60 with **59 disabled and 1 usable**, while Arti rejected all sixty at
     * runtime (`AllGuardsDown { n_accepted: 0, n_rejected: 60 }`) across repeated app restarts. The
     * lone survivor was just as unreachable as the rest — useless for recovery, but enough to veto
     * it, because `usable == 0` never became true. ~87% of relay connections failed indefinitely.
     *
     * So the test is proportional: a sample of at least [MIN_SAMPLE_TO_JUDGE_RATIO] whose usable
     * guards are under 1/[USABLE_RATIO_DIVISOR] of the total is wedged. A small, young sample is
     * still only judged by the strict `usable == 0` rule, so a legitimate first bootstrap that has
     * sampled one or two guards is never wiped out from under itself.
