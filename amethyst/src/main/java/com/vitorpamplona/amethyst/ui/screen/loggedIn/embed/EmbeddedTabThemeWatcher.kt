/**
 * Keeps the warm embedded tabs in sync with the app's DARK/LIGHT theme. An embed WebView resolves its
 * theme from the context it's built with (`nightThemedContext`), once, at construction — a runtime config
 * change does NOT re-flip the renderer — so the only way a live theme switch reaches an already-running
 * surface is to rebuild it. This watches the resolved theme and, on an actual flip, asks
 * [EmbeddedTabHost] to tear down + re-acquire every session in the new theme.
 *
 * Mount once next to [EmbeddedTabLayer]/[EmbeddedTabPreloader]. Draws nothing.
