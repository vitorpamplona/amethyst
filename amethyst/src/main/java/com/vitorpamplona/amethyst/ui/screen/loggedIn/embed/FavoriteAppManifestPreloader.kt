// If relays stay silent this long after launch, fall back to the device-cached manifest so a pinned

/**
 * Keeps every favorited nsite/napplet (a [FavoriteApp.NostrApp]) resolvable in [LocalCache] the way a
 * pinned web app's URL always is — closing the gap where [EmbeddedTabPreloader] could not warm a
 * Nostr-app favorite because its manifest event had simply never been fetched (favorites store only a
 * `kind:pubkey:dtag` coordinate, and nothing pulled that addressable event in until the user opened
 * the napplet/nsite discovery screen). For each favorite this:
 *
 *  1. subscribes to the manifest's addressable coordinate (via [observeNote] → the EventFinder), so the
 *     latest version is pulled from the author's relays into [LocalCache];
 *  2. persists whatever version resolves back into the device-local favorites store, so the next cold
 *     start (or an offline one) has it immediately; and
 *  3. if relays stay silent shortly after launch, seeds [LocalCache] from that cached copy.
 *
 * Mounted once in the logged-in shell, independent of the API-30 embedded-surface gate: the
 * full-screen launcher ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.favorites.FavoriteAppLauncher]) benefits from a
 * resolved manifest on every device too. Draws nothing; it just drives acquisition.
