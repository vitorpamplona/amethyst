 *
 * Fetching the votes is **not** this class's job — that is
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.loggedIn.polls.results.datasources.PollResponsesFilterAssembler],
 * the same lifecycle-aware, deduplicated, EOSE-tracked subscription every other current-screen data
 * source uses. What is left here is the one question a subscription cannot answer: how many events
 * exist that we did not receive.
 *
 * See [mergeCountResults] for why a COUNT fan-out is never summed — relays mirror each other, so
 * adding their counts would multiply the poll.
