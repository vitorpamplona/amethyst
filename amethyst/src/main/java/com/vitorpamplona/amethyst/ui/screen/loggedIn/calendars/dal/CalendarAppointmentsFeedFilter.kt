     * weakly held, and is what [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.CachePruner] sweeps on every app
     * switch.
     *
     * Scanning `notes` here meant the full rebuild and the live update disagreed about which object
     * represents an appointment: the same event arrived under two different [Note.idHex] values, so
     * it could sit in the feed twice, and each rebuild after a resume swapped one identity for the
     * other — the views flickered events in and out on every trip through the background. An edit
     * showed up as a second entry for the same appointment, too, since both versions matched.
     *
     * [CalendarCollectionsFeedFilter] and [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.dal.ArticlesFeedFilter]
     * already read addressables this way; this is the same query, narrowed to a kind range instead
     * of walking every note in the cache.
