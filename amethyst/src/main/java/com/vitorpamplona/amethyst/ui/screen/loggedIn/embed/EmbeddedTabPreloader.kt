/**
 * Warms every bottom-bar favorite at startup so the first tap is instant — the surfaces are built,
 * attached (off-screen), and their content downloaded before the user ever opens them. Idle work that
 * shares the exact warm sessions the favorite screens use (same ids via [EmbeddedTabFactory]).
 *
 * Mount once next to [EmbeddedTabLayer]. Draws nothing; it just drives acquisition. Napplet favorites
 * whose events haven't synced yet, and Tor-routed sites whose proxy isn't up yet, are retried for a
 * bounded window (the latter so a clearnet preload can never race ahead of Tor) — that retry loop, and
 * everything else that has to suspend, lives in [EmbeddedTabPreloadSweeper]; this composable only kicks
 * it off, synchronously.
