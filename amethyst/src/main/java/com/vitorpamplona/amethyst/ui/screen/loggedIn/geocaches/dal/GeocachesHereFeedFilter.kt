 * The live geocaches whose geohash ladder overlaps [geohash].

 * Deliberately narrower and wider than [GeocachesFeedFilter] at once: narrower because it only
 * admits caches in this cell, wider because it applies no top-nav follow list. A geohash screen
 * answers "what is *here*", and a cache hidden by a stranger is still here — filtering it out
 * would make the chip claim a place is empty when it is not.
