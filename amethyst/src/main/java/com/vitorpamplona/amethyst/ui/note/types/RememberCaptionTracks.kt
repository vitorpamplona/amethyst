/**
 * Resolves the caption tracks a NIP-71 video advertises, fetching the addressable ones.
 *
 * A `text-track` that names a URL is usable immediately. One that names a
 * `39307:<pubkey>:<d>` coordinate is not, so it gets an [observeNoteEvent] of its own — that both
 * reads the event out of LocalCache and puts it on an EventFinder subscription, so a track the
 * device has never seen is requested from relays and appears when it lands.
 *
 * The same track is routinely advertised both ways at once (divine.video publishes the Blossom URL
 * and its wrapping event side by side), so the two are merged by URL: the player is handed one
 * configuration per distinct file, never a duplicate pair it would offer twice in its track menu.
