/**
 * The minimal surface controls [EmbeddedTabHost] needs to keep a session warm regardless of whether
 * it's a browser ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.loggedIn.browser.EmbeddedWebAppController])
 * or an nsite/napplet ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.loggedIn.favorites.EmbeddedNostrAppController]).
 *
 * Warm-keep works by keeping the session's [SandboxedSdkView] **attached** to the window the whole
 * time (just moved off-screen when not active) — the privacy-sandbox view only closes its session on
 * detach, so an attached-but-hidden view stays alive. [onShown]/[onHidden] let a controller pause its
 * applet's JS while hidden; [teardown] tears the session down for good (eviction).
