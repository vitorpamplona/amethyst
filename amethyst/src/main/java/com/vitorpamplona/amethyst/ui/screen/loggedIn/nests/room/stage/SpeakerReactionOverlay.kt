/**
 * Floating-emoji overlay drawn under a speaker's avatar. Each
 * incoming `kind-7` becomes its own independent chip — two
 * reactions arriving in quick succession produce two concurrent
 * rises, not one shared chip that restarts. The previous
 * implementation grouped by content and used `youngestSec` as a
 * `remember` key, which meant a second `🔥` from the same speaker
 * interrupted the first chip's animation and showed `×2` instead
 * of two distinct floating emojis.
 *
 * Reactions live for [REACTION_WINDOW_SEC] seconds in the
 * aggregator; each chip animates over [REACTION_RISE_MS] and then
 * stays invisible (alpha=0) until the aggregator evicts it. We cap
 * the visible-chip count at [MAX_VISIBLE_CHIPS] so a flurry of
 * reactions doesn't bleed the Row into the next column.
