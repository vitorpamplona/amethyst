/**
 * When [content] is blank, returns [event]'s NIP-92 `imeta` URLs joined one per line so an attachment
 * carried only as an `imeta` tag (empty content) still renders. The shared media renderer only shows
 * media whose URL appears in the text, but some NIP-C7/Concord clients (e.g. Ditto/Soapbox Armada)
 * attach an image purely as an `imeta` tag and leave the content empty — symmetric to
 * [com.vitorpamplona.quartz.concord.cord03Channels.ChannelChat.imageMessage], which appends the URL
 * on send. Encrypted-blob key/nonce are already registered by URL, so the shared pipeline fetches and
 * decrypts them transparently.
 *
 * Returns [content] unchanged whenever it is non-blank (the common case) or [event] is null / carries
 * no imeta URLs, so any message that already has text is untouched.
