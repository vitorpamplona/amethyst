/**
 * Swipe-to-navigate gesture for calendar surfaces. Horizontal drag past the threshold fires
 * [onSwipeLeft] (next period) or [onSwipeRight] (previous period). The threshold is in pixels
 * — we accumulate raw drag deltas because [detectHorizontalDragGestures]' final-velocity callback
 * isn't surfaced here; a positional threshold gives the user predictable, latch-style behaviour
 * comparable to the previous/next arrows in [CalendarNavigationHeader].
 *
 * The `key` lets a host that swaps state (week → next week, day → next day) restart the gesture
 * detector so a long sequence of partial drags doesn't accumulate across navigations.
