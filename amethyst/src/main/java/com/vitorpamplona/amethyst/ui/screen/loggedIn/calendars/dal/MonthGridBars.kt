 * One bar drawn into one day cell, with `lane` controlling its vertical position so two
 * overlapping multi-day events stack rather than collide. `isLeftEnd` / `isRightEnd` control
 * which corners of the bar are rounded — a continuation day in the middle of a 3-day event gets
 * neither end rounded, so adjacent cells visually merge into one bar.
 *
 * Note: the underlying [Note] is exposed so the UI can colour or label bars per event. Equality
 * is on idHex so a row of cells holding the same bar share segment identity for keys.
