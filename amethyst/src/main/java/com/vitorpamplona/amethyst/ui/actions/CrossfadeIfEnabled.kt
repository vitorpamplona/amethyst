/**
 * A [MyCrossfade] that does not build its [androidx.compose.animation.core.Transition] until there
 * is something to animate.
 *
 * `updateTransition` allocates a transition, its animation list and its seeking state on *first
 * composition*, even though first composition has nothing to cross-fade — target and initial state
 * are the same value. In a feed that is waste: every card scrolled in builds a transition per
 * animated element, and during a scroll essentially none of them run, because the underlying counts
 * and icons do not change in the second a card is on screen.
 *
 * So the plain content renders until the target actually moves. At that point the transition is
 * built seeded at the *original* value via [MutableTransitionState] and immediately re-targeted at
 * the new one, so the first real change still animates exactly as before; every later change
 * animates through the now-live transition normally.
