/**
 * REQ for the logged-in creator's own Podcasting-2.0 catalog, so the authoring hub reliably shows
 * their show, episodes and trailers even on a fresh install (rather than only what happens to be in
 * [LocalCache]). Queried on the creator's own outbox relays.
 *
 * Two separate filters per relay, and they can't be merged:
 * - episodes (kind 30054) + trailers (kind 30055) by author, with no tag constraint; and
 * - the show metadata (kind 30078) constrained to `#d=["podcast-metadata"]`. That NIP-78 app-data
 *   kind is heavily overloaded, so without the `#d` constraint this REQ would pull every app's data
 *   (including the user's private settings) for the pubkey. The constraint must stay off the episodes
 *   filter, since each episode/trailer carries its own `d` tag — a combined `#d` would match nothing.
