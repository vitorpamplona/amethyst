 * The threat model is worth stating because it is unusual: the key arrives by pointing a camera
 * at an object in the physical world, which means it is attacker-controlled input that the user
 * has been socially engineered into trusting. So:
 *
 * - it is parsed defensively (hex or nsec, exactly 32 bytes, non-zero) before it touches crypto;
 * - it is used for exactly one signature, on [Dispatchers.Default], through a throwaway
 *   [NostrSignerInternal] that is not retained anywhere;
 * - it is never written to state, never logged, never persisted, and the local reference is
 *   dropped as soon as the 7517 exists;
 * - the resulting 7517 is validated against the listing before it is shown as proof, so a code
 *   from a *different* cache reads as a mistake rather than silently producing a log that every
 *   other client will reject.
