/**
 * Entry for a NIP-CC geocache listing (kind 37516): decodes the [Note] and renders the shared
 * commons [GeocacheCard], supplying the native map hero as its slot.
 *
 * "Claimed" is read off the listing's own `F` tag rather than computed from the cache's found
 * logs. NIP-CC makes `F` the authoritative answer once the owner publishes it ("clients MUST
 * attribute the exclusive claim to the pubkey in the `F` tag"), and it travels inside the event,
 * so a card can state it without holding the logs. The provisional, timestamp-ordered winner
 * needs every verified log for the cache and belongs on a screen that subscribes to them —
 * deriving it from whatever replies happen to be in memory would render a claim that flickers.

 * costs nothing and yields a distance whenever something else (the Around Me feed, the location
 * picker) has already asked. Where nothing has, the card simply shows no distance.

 * The proof badge is decided here rather than in the card because deciding it needs the cache
 * listing: a `verification` tag is only a string until it has been checked against the listing's
 * verification key, this log's own author, and the cache the log claims. So the listing is
 * loaded and observed — which also asks the relays for it — and until it arrives the answer is
 * [FoundLogProof.UNKNOWN], which the card renders as no badge at all rather than an optimistic
 * one.
 *
 * Two things are deliberately kept off the composition thread's critical path:
 *
 * - The cheap gate is [GeocacheFoundLogEvent.hasVerificationAttached], which reads tag names.
 *   Parsing the embedded 7517 means running the payload through the JSON parser and the event
 *   factory, and a feed must not pay for that on every recomposition of every log.
 * - Validating it costs a SHA-256 and a secp256k1 verification, which is not a composition-thread
 *   amount of work, so it runs in [produceState] on [Dispatchers.Default].
