/**
 * Waits for the soft keyboard to be fully off screen. Installed on [Nav] so that every navigation
 * in the app serializes the IME and window animations instead of overlapping them.
 *
 * Navigating while the keyboard is up races the window animation against the IME's close animation.
 * On release builds — fast enough that the window animation wins — the IME
 * [WindowInsetsAnimationCompat][androidx.core.view.WindowInsetsAnimationCompat] is cancelled before
 * its terminal (zero) frame reaches Compose. `WindowInsets.ime` is a single app-wide holder, so it
 * stays "animating" and every `Modifier.imePadding()` in the app — not just the screen being left —
 * freezes at the keyboard height until some later inset pass happens to rebalance it.
 *
 * This is not a composer-screen problem, which is why it lives here rather than in the screens.
 * Any destination that can hold focus in a text field can strand the padding on the way out, by any
 * exit: a back gesture, a top-bar button, a bottom-nav tab, or tapping a result. Search is the
 * clearest case — it focuses its field on arrival, so the keyboard is already up before the user
 * has done anything, and every way out of it is a navigation.

/**

 *
 * Focus is cleared before hiding so nothing re-requests the IME as it retracts. The wait is bounded
 * by [IME_SETTLE_TIMEOUT_MS] — if the inset never reports zero, which is precisely the failure this
 * guards against, navigation still proceeds rather than stranding the user on the screen.
