/**
 * The 256 colours an object's palette indices name, fetched when the object
 * names them in another event (DECK-0003 §1.3a).
 *
 * `colors` is an index into a palette and the payload says which one: absent
 * means the built-in, a list means the object carries its own, and an `nevent`
 * or `naddr` means somebody else's event holds it. Until that event is in hand,
 * an object that names one is drawn against the built-in — §1.3b is explicit
 * that a reference which has not resolved "counts as a failed fetch, which
 * means the built-in", never a refusal to draw. So this hands back null first
 * and the palette after, and the object appears immediately and repaints once.
 *
 * **Pinned to the event named, and never to a newer one.** §1.3a: "A reader
 * MUST NOT follow the `e` chain forward to a newer version, and MUST render the
 * object with the event the object names." That is why an `nevent` is loaded by
 * its own id. An `naddr` is accepted too, for a palette somebody publishes as an
 * addressable event of their own, and there the address *is* what was named.
 *
 * Fetching matters more than it sounds. Every palette on the network today is a
 * `kind 3367` colour moment of three to six colours, so an object built against
 * one and drawn against the built-in 256 is not slightly off — it is a
 * different object, in colours its author never chose. It can also stop being
 * drawable: an index of 238 is fine against 256 entries and out of range
 * against five, and §1.3 makes that a defect in the payload rather than
 * something to clamp. Both are the format working as written.
