/**
 * Publish-side of the kind-10312 presence loop. Three things wired
 * together as one composable:
 *
 *   - **Heartbeat** — emit on enter, on hand-raise toggle, on
 *     onstage transition, then every [PRESENCE_REFRESH_MS]. Mute
 *     and publishing flags are intentionally NOT keys: every mute
 *     toggle would otherwise round-trip a presence emit (audit
 *     Android #11). The heartbeat reads them via
 *     [rememberUpdatedState] so each refresh picks up the latest
 *     value WITHOUT cancelling and restarting the loop — without
 *     that wrapper the captured-at-launch values stay frozen and
 *     a 30 s refresh would overwrite a fresh mute toggle with the
 *     pre-toggle state, hiding the avatar's mute icon.
 *
 *   - **Debounce** — after a mute toggle, wait
 *     [PRESENCE_DEBOUNCE_MS] for further changes before sending a
 *     fresh presence. The LaunchedEffect's auto-cancel on key
 *     change is the debounce mechanism. Skipped while we're not
 *     broadcasting (`micMutedTag == null`); otherwise the FIRST
 *     composition would publish twice within 500 ms (heartbeat
 *     immediately + debounce-publisher 500 ms later, both with
 *     muted=null) — audit round-2 Android #10.
 *
 *   - **Final leave** — onDispose runs a non-cancellable
 *     publishPresence(publishing=false, onstage=false) so the
 *     "I'm gone" event survives the composable's scope being
 *     cancelled mid-network. Without this the leave event almost
 *     never reaches the relay (audit Android #12).
