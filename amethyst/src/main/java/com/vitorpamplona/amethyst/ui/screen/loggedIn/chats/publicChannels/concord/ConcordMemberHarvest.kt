/**
 * A headless, run-once background sweep that fills in a Concord community's **full** member roster.
 *
 * The live channel subscriptions only carry the recent tail the relay serves, so [observedAuthors]
 * (CORD-02 §5) sees only recent posters — a fraction of the real membership. This pages every folded
 * channel's history back to [CONCORD_MEMBER_HARVEST_WINDOW_SECS] in one pooled fetch. The wraps ride
 * the app's normal ingest (the global `CacheClientConnector` → `concordSessions.ingest`), which decrypts
 * each and folds its author into `observedAuthors` — so the members screen's count fills in as the sweep
 * runs, with no extra plumbing here. `session.beginMemberHarvest()` gates it to once per community.
 *
 * Mount it from the members screen; it self-cancels with the composition. AUTH is free — the channel
 * planes' stream keys are already registered for these relays (same path the live sub uses).
