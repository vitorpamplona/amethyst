/**
 * A synthetic Messages-list row that collapses ALL of a user's channels in one Concord
 * [communityId] into a single entry — the "grouped by community" view mode
 * ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.model.concord.ConcordViewMode.GROUPED]). It is the
 * Concord analog of [RelayGroupServerRoomNote] (NIP-29 groups by host relay; Concord groups
 * by community).
 *
 * It is not a real event: [event] stays null and [createdAt] mirrors [newestMessage] (the
 * newest decrypted message across that community's channels) so the row interleaves with DMs
 * and other chats by recency. Tapping it opens the community's channel list. Exactly one
 * instance exists per community — keyed by a stable [idHex] so feed diffing and the LazyColumn
 * treat it as the same row across refreshes.
