/**
 * [BarcodeDecoder] on zxing-cpp (Apache-2.0).

 * Every option here maps to a failure the previous zxing-android-embedded scanner had:
 *
 * - `tryInvert` replaces the old `MIXED_SCAN`, which inverted *alternate frames* and so threw
 *   away half of all decode attempts on ordinary dark-on-light codes. zxing-cpp does the
 *   inverted pass as a fallback inside one call, so nothing is wasted.
 * - `tryRotate` picks up codes held sideways.
 * - `tryDownscale` finds codes that fill most of the frame, which a fixed-scale detector misses.
 * - `tryHarder`/`tryDenoise` (Thorough only) are what actually rescue blurred, creased,
 *   low-contrast and photographed-off-a-screen codes.
 * - `maxNumberOfSymbols = MAX_SYMBOLS` so several codes in frame become a choice for the user
 *   rather than a coin flip.
