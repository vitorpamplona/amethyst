/**
 * A synthetic Messages-list row that collapses ALL of a user's joined NIP-29 groups on one host
 * [relay] into a single entry — the "grouped by relay" view mode
 * ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.model.nip29RelayGroups.RelayGroupViewMode.GROUPED]).
 *
 * It is not a real event: [event] stays null and [createdAt] mirrors [newestMessage] (the newest
 * chat across that relay's groups) so the row interleaves with DMs and other chats by recency and
 * lands in "the newest message spot". Tapping it opens the relay's group list. Exactly one instance
 * exists per relay — never duplicated — keyed by a stable [idHex] so feed diffing and the
 * LazyColumn treat it as the same row across refreshes.
