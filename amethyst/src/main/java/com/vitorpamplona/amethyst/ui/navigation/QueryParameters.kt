/**
 * The value of [parameterName] in this URI's query string, without going through
 * `java.net.URI`.
 *
 * Needed because `java.net.URI` only exposes `rawQuery` for *hierarchical* URIs. A URI
 * with a scheme and no `//` is **opaque** — everything after the colon is one
 * scheme-specific part — so `URI("marmot:<hex>?account=npub1…").rawQuery` is null. That
 * is the shape `NotificationRoutes.marmotUri`
 * produces, so every Marmot group notification silently lost its `?account=` and opened
 * the group under whichever account happened to be current instead of switching first.
 *
 * Splitting on the first `?` gets the same answer for both shapes, and returns null for a
 * bare `nevent1…` with no query at all.
 *
 * `UriParser` reads an opaque query correctly too, and is the
 * right tool when a URI is already known to be well-formed. It is not this one: it builds a
 * `java.net.URI`, which *throws* on anything that is not a legal URI. What arrives here comes
 * from an exported, browsable scheme, so it can be any string at all, and every caller on the
 * deep-link path treats an unreadable uri as "no route" rather than as a crash.
