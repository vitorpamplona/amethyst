/**
 * Authors a CORD-02 §6 encrypted community image and returns the [ImagePointer] to seal in the
 * community metadata — the exact inverse of [rememberConcordImageModel]'s read path, and the same
 * scheme Armada's `encryptImageBlob` + Blossom upload uses in `concord-v2/lib/image.ts`.
 *
 * Rather than hand-roll the upload, this drives the **standard** [UploadOrchestrator.uploadEncrypted]
 * pipeline that DM/chat encrypted media uses, so a community icon gets the same treatment as any
 * other attachment: image compression ([CompressorQuality]), EXIF/metadata stripping, and the
 * account's configured Blossom server. The only Concord-specific parts are the fresh [AESGCM] cipher
 * (whose key/nonce we keep to build the pointer) and mapping the orchestrator's result — the
 * ciphertext `url` plus the *plaintext* `hashBeforeEncryption` — into the [ImagePointer] shape.
