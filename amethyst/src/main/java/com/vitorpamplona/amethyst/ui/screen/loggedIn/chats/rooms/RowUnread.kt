/**
 * Whether one Messages row is showing a blue dot — the SAME question each row composable answers for
 * itself in [ChatroomHeaderCompose], hoisted so the bottom-bar badge can ask it about every row.
 *
 * The badge used to run on `unreadPrivateChatRoute` alone, which opens with
 * `if (newestMessage !is ChatroomKeyable) return null`. Only NIP-17/NIP-04 DM events implement that
 * interface, so eight of the nine row types — public chats, ephemeral rooms, geohash cells, Marmot
 * groups, NIP-29/Buzz channels and Concord channels, plus both collapsed "grouped" rows — were
 * silently skipped: their row could show a dot while the envelope stayed clean.
 *
 * Returns null when the row cannot be unread at all (no event, my own newest message in a DM, everyone
 * hidden), so callers can skip it rather than subscribe to a flow that is always false. A muted public
 * chat is deliberately NOT one of these cases: mute is a runtime-toggleable setting, not a structural
 * fact about the row, so it is folded into the emitted `Flow<Boolean>` (via [publicChatChannelIdOf] combined
 * with the mute set) instead of being resolved as a one-shot snapshot at construction time. Early-return
 * on a snapshot of the mute set would freeze the dot's mute state as of whenever the flow was built —
 * do not "simplify" this back into an early return.
 *
 * The two collapsed rows are why this carries a `Flow<Boolean>` rather than a `(route, createdAt)`
 * pair: their dot is a fan-in over every child channel, not one timestamp against one marker, and
 * approximating them by the newest child would miss an older channel that is still unread.

     * a seed every row would paint dotless and correct itself a frame later — a dot flash on every

     * `StateFlow` directly and was right immediately; this keeps that property.
