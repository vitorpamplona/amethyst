 * screen that hides rows in the first place. Hiding it would let a user lock themselves out of their
 * own configuration. Everything else the drawer always shows — the profile header, the relay-status
 * row, the account switcher and the version/QR footer — is fixed chrome rather than a catalog row,

 * The per-account preference stores the **hidden** items rather than the visible ones. That choice is
 * what makes a newly added destination appear for everyone automatically: a row nobody has ever
 * hidden simply isn't in the set, so it renders. Storing the visible list instead would freeze each
 * account's drawer at the moment they first touched the setting, and every later release would have
 * to migrate saved lists to introduce a screen.
