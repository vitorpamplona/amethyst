 * ([concordChannelLastReadRoute]) with the channel's own notes flow, so the count updates both
 * when a fresh message folds in and when the user opens the channel (which advances last-read).
 *
 * Uses `getOrCreate` (not `getIfExists`): a channel folded on the Control Plane may have no
 * message-buffer note yet, and the flow must still exist so the badge appears the moment its
 * first message lands. Counting straight off [ConcordChannel.notes] ignores the synthetic
 * placeholder note (it is never added to that cache) and any note with no timestamp.
