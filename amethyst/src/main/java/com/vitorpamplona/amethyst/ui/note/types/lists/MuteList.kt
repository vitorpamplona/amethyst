/**
 * NIP-51 kind 10000: the mute list.
 *
 * The only list whose members are of four different kinds at once — people, hashtags, words and
 * threads — so it is the one kind that cannot borrow another card's body. Each member is drawn as
 * what it actually is: a profile row for a person, a hashtag that opens its feed, a word as
 * itself, and a muted thread as the note it silences.
 *
 * Most mute lists are mostly private, and for anyone but their author this renders as a title and
 * an honest line saying so — which is the entire point, given that it used to render as the
 * NIP-44 ciphertext.
