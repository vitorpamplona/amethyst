/**
 * The context card above a comment whose parent isn't a note.
 *
 * A NIP-22 comment can be scoped to something that never resolves to an in-cache parent: an
 * external identifier (NIP-73 `I` tag -- a url, hashtag or geohash) or, for a top-level post in a
 * NIP-72 community, the community itself. Both render here so the two call sites -- the feed row
 * and the thread's own master note -- don't each repeat the choice.
 *
 * Renders nothing when the screen is already dedicated to this exact scope (see
 * [LocalCurrentExternalScope]), which would otherwise repeat the same preview on every row.
