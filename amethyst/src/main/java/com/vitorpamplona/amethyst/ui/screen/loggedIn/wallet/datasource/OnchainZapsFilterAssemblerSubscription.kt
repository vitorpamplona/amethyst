 * Lifecycle-aware relay subscription for kind-8333 zaps involving [user],
 * bounded by [windowSinceSeconds] (the oldest visible chain transaction's
 * blockTime) so the relay only ships zaps that could plausibly attribute to
 * what we're showing.

 * Re-subscribes whenever either input changes — scrolling back into older
 * transactions widens the window and re-queries; switching accounts swaps
