/**
 * The "Copy Text" flow shared by every menu that copies an event's text.
 *
 * The copy menus sit far from the `TranslatableRichTextViewer` that rendered (and possibly
 * translated) the note, so instead of plumbing the translated string down the hierarchy this
 * flow re-derives it from [cachedTranslation]: the process-wide translation cache keyed by
 * (content, language settings). By the time any copy menu is reachable the note has been
 * rendered, which is what populated that cache — so a hit means the user is looking at a
 * translation and gets a chooser (Copy Original / Copy Translated); a miss copies directly.
 *
 * What gets copied — and what the cache is keyed on — is [displayedNoteText], the same string
 * the viewer rendered, not the raw event content: a NIP-14 subject is part of what the user is
 * reading and of what was translated.
 *
 * Returns the click handler for the menu entry, taking the note the menu belongs to and the
 * version of it the screen is showing (the same note unless the post was edited — the body
 * comes from the version, the subject from the note itself, exactly as the viewer composes
 * them). [onCopied] runs after the text lands on the
 * clipboard, [onDismiss] when the chooser is cancelled without copying **or** when the note
 * can't be decrypted at all (a read-only account, a refused signer) so the menu still closes
 * instead of hanging on a copy that will never happen. Callers must keep their menu in
 * composition until one of the two runs, because the chooser dialog is emitted from this
 * composable.
