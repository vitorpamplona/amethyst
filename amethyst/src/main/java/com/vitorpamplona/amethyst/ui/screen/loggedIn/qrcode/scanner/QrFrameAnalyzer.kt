 *    `tryHarder` + `tryDenoise`. A stubborn code therefore still gets several expensive attempts
 *    a second, without the frame rate collapsing for codes that were never difficult.
 * 2. **Brightness is measured.** A sparse sample of the Y plane costs almost nothing and is what
 *    lets the UI offer the torch exactly when the scene is too dark, rather than parking a
 *    permanent button in the corner or firing the light at people unprompted.
