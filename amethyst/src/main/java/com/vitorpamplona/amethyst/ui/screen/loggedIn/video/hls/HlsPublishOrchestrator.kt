 * Delegates transcoding and segment/media-playlist upload plumbing to the library's
 * [com.davotoula.lightcompressor.hls.HlsUploadHelper] via the injected [runUpload] closure, then
 * uploads the rewritten master playlist itself, builds the NIP-71 event, signs, and publishes.
 * All Android/account-specific concerns are injected as suspending callbacks so the whole state
 * machine is unit-testable.
 *
 * State transitions: Idle → Transcoding (per rendition, driven by listener) → Uploading (per
 * segment/playlist upload, driven by the uploader lambda) → Publishing → Success, or → Failure
 * on any exception.
