 * analog of the NIP-04 rooms-list live tail
 * ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.loggedIn.chats.rooms.datasource.ChatroomListNip04SubAssembler]).
 *
 * **One subscription per joined group**, each a single-valued `#h` filter with `since = recentBoundary()`
 * and no `limit` — a time floor bounds it, so it stays reconnect-safe. This keeps the Messages-list
 * previews reflecting the true newest message, and joined groups' recent chat warm in cache, without
 * opening each one. Older history is the [RelayGroupOpenChatHistorySubAssembler]'s job (below the floor).
 *
 * These used to be batched into one subscription per host relay carrying every group id in a single `#h`.
 * That is valid NIP-01 and relays answer it correctly for stored queries, but it silently breaks *live*
 * delivery on `block/buzz`, which can only index a subscription under one channel and downgrades a
 * multi-id one to "global" — a class that by design receives no channel-scoped events. The batched tail
 * therefore backfilled at EOSE and then went permanently deaf, freezing the Messages row while the open
 * chat (always single-valued) stayed live. See [buildRelayGroupJoinedChatTailFilter] for the full trace.
