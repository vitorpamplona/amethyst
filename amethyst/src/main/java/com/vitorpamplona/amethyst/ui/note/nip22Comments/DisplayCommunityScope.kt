/**
 * The parent-context card for a top-level NIP-72 community post.
 *
 * Such a post answers the community itself, so there is no parent *note* to render -- without
 * this the slot above the post is simply empty. [ShortCommunityHeaderNoActions] is reused because
 * it degrades gracefully: it falls back to the address' `d` tag while the definition event is
 * still in flight, and its `observeNoteEvent` is what asks the relays for that definition in the
 * first place.
