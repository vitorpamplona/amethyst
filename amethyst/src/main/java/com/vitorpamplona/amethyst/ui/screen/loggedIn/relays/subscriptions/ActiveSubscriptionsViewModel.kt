 * Pivots on **purpose**, not on relay. The relay-shaped view cannot answer the question: a probe
 * holding 670 filters across 168 relays looks like one unremarkable chip repeated on 168 rows,
 * whereas here it is a single line that reads `Notifications · 670 filters · 168 relays` and is
 * immediately obviously the largest thing running.
 *
 * Grouped by account first because several accounts are normally logged in and they do not share
 * relay sets — a total that mixes them cannot be acted on.
 *
 * Everything is a **snapshot**, polled rather than observed: `activeRequests` is a plain map read
 * off the relay pool with no change feed, and subscriptions churn constantly (every EOSE advances a
 * `since`). Polling on a visible screen is honest and cheap; a push feed would mean instrumenting
 * the pool for a diagnostic screen.
