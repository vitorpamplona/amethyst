/**
 * Process-level holder of **warm embedded sessions** — the persistent-surface-layer half of keep-warm.
 * Each warm session's [SandboxedSdkView][androidx.privacysandbox.ui.client.view.SandboxedSdkView] is
 * rendered by [EmbeddedTabLayer] and stays attached to the window the whole time, so its WebView (in
 * the keyless `:napplet` process) keeps its full JS state; the active one is positioned over the
 * current tab's content area, the rest sit off-screen but alive.
 *
 * Warm-keep is scoped to **bottom-row apps**: a session is retained only while its app is a bottom-bar
 * favorite (see [retainOnly], driven by the bottom-bar settings). A favorite opened outside the bottom
 * row restarts when it leaves, and a low-memory trim ([rebuildAll]) drops everything.
 *
 * State is Compose snapshot state so [EmbeddedTabLayer] recomposes as sessions / the active id / the
 * content bounds change. Main-thread only.
