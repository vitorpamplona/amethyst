/**
 * Always-on discovery of the viewer's Buzz **DM channels** across every joined workspace relay, mounted
 * once high in the logged-in tree ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.loggedIn.LoggedInPage]).
 *
 * The deployed relay does not expose a queryable DM list; it addresses each member a kind-44100
 * member-added notification (`#p` = me). Those arrive through the ordinary subscription pipeline —
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.relayClient.reqCommand.account.buzz.BuzzMembershipEoseManager]
 * owns the one `#p=me` REQ per workspace relay — so this reads them back out of [LocalCache], fetches
 * each discovered channel's 39000-39003 directory (so its `t`=dm marker + participants land), and
 * records the ones that turn out to be DMs into [BuzzDmChannels]. The companion
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.loggedIn.chats.publicChannels.relayGroup.datasource.BuzzDmJoinedChatTailPreload]
 * then keeps those channels' messages warm app-wide — which is what lets a Buzz DM show on the
 * Notifications tab and in push without the viewer opening the conversation first.
 *
 * Everything else somebody added the viewer to is a named channel; it must NOT be silently subscribed,
 * so it stays out of [BuzzDmChannels] and surfaces as a prompt instead — see
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.buzz.ChannelInvitesState], which projects the
 * same cached notices.
 *
 * ### Recompute, don't accumulate
 *
 * Each pass derives the whole membership picture from the cache and *declares* the result
 * ([BuzzDmChannels.replace]). The previous incremental version — record every 44100, then delete the
 * ones classification rejected — had no memory of its own rejections, so the next delivery of the same
 * event re-added them and the two steps fought each other in a loop. A recomputation cannot fight
 * itself: the same events always produce the same set.
