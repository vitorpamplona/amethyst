 * A button label that shows work in progress.

 * Every cordn action screen tracked a `busy` flag and spent it only on
 * `enabled = !busy`, so the whole signal that anything was happening was a
 * button going grey. Backup and restore derive a key with scrypt — slow by
 * design — and migration publishes to relays, so "grey for a few seconds"
 * was indistinguishable from "did not register the tap".
