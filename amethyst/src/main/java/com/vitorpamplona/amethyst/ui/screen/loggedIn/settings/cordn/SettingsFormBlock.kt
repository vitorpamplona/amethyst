/**
 * Form content inside a `SettingsSection`.
 *
 * The section's card deliberately has no padding of its own: it is built for
 * rows like `SettingsItem`, which carry theirs so a divider can run edge to
 * edge between them. cordn's pages are forms rather than row lists — text
 * fields, explainers and buttons — and those need the inset the rows would
 * otherwise have supplied.
 *
 * One helper rather than a `Modifier.padding(16.dp)` repeated down five
 * screens, so the pages stay identical to each other as they change.
