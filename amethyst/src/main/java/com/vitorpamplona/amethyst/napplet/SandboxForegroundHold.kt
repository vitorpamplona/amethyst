/**
 * Keeps Amethyst's **main** process in "resumed" resource posture while a full-screen sandbox surface
 * (a `:napplet`-process browser/napplet/nSite host) is in the foreground.
 *
 * The problem it solves: opening one of those full-screen surfaces backgrounds `MainActivity`. Its
 * Compose collectors (`ManageRelayServices` / `ManageWebOkHttp`) are lifecycle-aware, so they stop —
 * and the underlying `WhileSubscribed` flows then scale everything down on their timers: Tor's port
 * after ~2 s, the relay pool after ~30 s, dropping the relay AUTH sessions with it. The user is still
 * actively using a Nostr surface (the sandbox brokers NIP-07 + relays back through this very process),
 * so tearing the network down is wrong — the next signed request or relay read pays a full reconnect.
 *
 * The fix is a **ref-counted hold**, acquired only while such a surface is foreground. While the count
 * is > 0 it subscribes to exactly the flows the resumed UI subscribes to — keeping Tor, the relay pool,
 * and the AUTH sessions up. When the last surface leaves, it releases and normal background scaling
 * resumes. It deliberately does *not* keep anything alive when nothing is foreground, so the intended
 * battery/bandwidth scaling is preserved.
 *
 * Switching between several sandbox surfaces must not restart the network. Android tears the old
 * surface down and brings the new one up as `old.onPause() → new.onResume()`, which would dip the
 * count to 0 and back to 1. To keep the same collectors running straight through that dip, releasing to
 * 0 only *schedules* the stop after a short [LINGER_MS] linger; a re-acquire within the window cancels
 * the pending stop and the existing collectors are never even cancelled — so swapping between open
 * napplets/nSites/browser apps holds Tor + relays + AUTH perfectly steady.
 *
 * Embedded favorite tabs need no hold: they render inside `MainActivity`, which stays resumed.
 *
 * Threading: [acquire]/[release] are `@Synchronized` and may be called from any thread (Activity main
 * thread, broker IPC handler). The keep-alive collectors run on [AppModules.applicationIOScope].
