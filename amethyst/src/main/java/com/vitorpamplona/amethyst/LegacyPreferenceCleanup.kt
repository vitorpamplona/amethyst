/**
 * Deletes an account's `secret_keeper_<npub>` file, but only once it can prove
 * nothing in it would be lost.
 *
 * # Why the check is not one rule
 *
 * The two halves of the migration are in different states, and asking the same
 * question of both would give the wrong answer for one of them.
 *
 * The plain per-account groups — settings, dialogs, feeds, cached events —
 * stopped being written to the legacy file when they moved, so that file is a
 * frozen snapshot of the day they migrated. Comparing values would flag every
 * setting the user has changed since. What is actually being asked of them is
 * "did the copy run", and [LegacyKeyTable.hasRun] answers it exactly:
 * `CopyOnceMigration` writes the values and its marker as a single
 * `Preferences`, committed atomically, so the marker cannot be set without them.
 *
 * The private key takes the strongest form: read it back and require it to
 * equal the legacy one. That comparison stays valid forever, because an npub is
 * derived from its private key, so the key for a given npub can never change.
 *
 * The secrets cannot be compared, and the reason is worth stating because the
 * obvious reading is wrong. They *are* dual-written today — but this whole
 * check only runs once [legacyWritesRetired] is true, and from that release on
 * the legacy copy is frozen while the live one keeps moving. An account that
 * re-pairs a bunker or adds a wallet after upgrading would then differ from the
 * file forever and never have it deleted. So they are gated the same way as the
 * plain groups: on the copy having run, which
 * [AccountSecretsEncryptedStores.loadSecrets] reports by returning non-null
 * only once its marker is set, and it writes that marker last.
 *
 * # Why an unrecognised key blocks
 *
 * A list of keys to check, maintained by hand, fails silently in the one
 * direction that matters: a key added later that no migration carries. So the
 * check runs the other way round — every key *in the file* must be claimed by
 * a table, be one of the secrets, or be on [accepted], the short list of
 * deliberate losses. Anything else stops the deletion and says so by name.
 *
 * # Cost
 *
 * [LegacyPreferenceSource.keys] goes through `EncryptedSharedPreferences.all`,
 * which decrypts every value in the file — there is no keys-only API. It is
 * called from the one place an account load is not already cached, so it costs
 * at most once per account per process, and nothing at all while
 * [legacyWritesRetired] is false.
 *
 * # Why deletion also waits on the legacy writes
 *
 * [legacyWritesRetired] is the other half. While the app still mirrors into
 * this file on every save, deleting it achieves nothing — the next save
 * recreates it, with a subset of what was there. Worse, it would look like it
 * had worked. So the file is only removed once it is no longer being written,
 * which is a separate release from this one.
