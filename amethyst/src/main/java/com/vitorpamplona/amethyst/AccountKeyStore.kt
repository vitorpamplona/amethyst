/**
 * Moves account private keys off `androidx.security.crypto` without ever
 * leaving one only in a place the running build cannot read.
 *
 * The old home is `secret_keeper_<npub>`, an EncryptedSharedPreferences file.
 * The new one is [SecureKeyStorage], which on Android is now an encrypted
 * DataStore sealed by the AndroidKeyStore directly. Both are written on every
 * save, and reads prefer the new store but fall back to the old one, so:
 *
 *  - an install that has never run this build still finds its key, and is
 *    migrated the first time the account loads;
 *  - a build rolled back to reading only the old store still finds every key,
 *    including ones added after the upgrade;
 *  - a new store that cannot be read — a wiped AndroidKeyStore after a device
 *    credential reset, say — falls back rather than presenting the account as
 *    having no key, which would silently demote it to read-only.
 *
 * Nothing is deleted here, and the legacy *reader* is permanent — see
 * [EncryptedStorage]. The migration is lazy, so an install that skips the
 * release introducing this store still needs the old file readable when it
 * finally arrives. What a later release can drop is the legacy **write**, once
 * every key in that file has a new home; several still do not.
 *
 * The two stores cannot legitimately disagree: an npub is derived from its
 * private key, so the key for a given npub never changes. A mismatch means
 * corruption, and is resolved in favour of the older, proven store.
