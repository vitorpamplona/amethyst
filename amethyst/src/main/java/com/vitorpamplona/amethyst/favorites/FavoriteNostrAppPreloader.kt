/**
 * Pre-fetches the addressable events behind the user's favorited [FavoriteApp.NostrApp]s (nSites /
 * nApplets) while a screen that can launch them is on screen.
 *
 * A favorite stores only the addressable coordinate `kind:pubkey:dtag`, never the event. The launch
 * path ([FavoriteAppLauncher.launchNostrApp] / [FavoriteAppLauncher.embedParams]) re-resolves the live
 * event from [LocalCache] at tap time, so a favorite whose event hasn't streamed in yet can't launch —
 * the user gets the "isn't loaded yet" toast / unavailable tab. Before this preloader, the only thing
 * that pulled those events into the cache was visiting the nsite/napplet feed (it subscribes by author),
 * which is why opening that feed and coming back made a favorite suddenly launchable.
 *
 * This subscribes each favorited coordinate to the shared
 * [EventFinder][com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.relayClient.reqCommand.event.EventFinderFilterAssembler]
 * — the same lifecycle-aware loader [observeNote][com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.relayClient.reqCommand.event.observeNote]
 * uses — so the manifests fetch (via the author's outbox relays) as soon as the launcher opens and are
 * already in [LocalCache] by the time the user taps. The loader drops each coordinate from its filter
 * once the event arrives, so this is a one-shot fetch, not a standing feed.
