/**
 * In-memory, warm-cached view over one account's [RelayAuthPermissionStore] (a per-account file —
 * see [DataStoreRelayAuthPermissionStore] built from `accounts/<pubkey>/`). Held on the
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.Account] like the other state caches.
 *
 * The ALLOW/DENY overrides are the only thing read on the hot NIP-42 decision path
 * ([RelayAuthPermissionLedger.decide]). They are snapshotted into memory once, right after the
 * account loads, and served from there — so an incoming AUTH challenge is answered without a disk
 * read (a slow disk hit here would stall login-time relay auth). Writes update memory *and* disk.
 *
 * Rationale + last-used are read only by the settings screen, off the hot path, so they pass
 * straight through to disk. Implements [RelayAuthPermissionStore] so it drops into every existing
 * call site (the ledger and the settings screen) unchanged.
