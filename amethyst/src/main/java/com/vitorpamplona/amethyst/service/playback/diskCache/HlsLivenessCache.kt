package com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.playback.diskCache

import androidx.collection.LruCache

/**
 * Remembers, per media URL, whether ExoPlayer determined a stream to be live once it parsed the
 * playlist. This is how the cache tells a live HLS FAST channel from an immutable on-demand HLS
 * rendition — a distinction the `.m3u8` URL alone cannot make.
 *
 * A `.m3u8` cannot be classified before it is fetched, so the very first play of a URL is unknown
 * and routed conservatively to the non-caching source (see CustomMediaSourceFactory). Once the
 * timeline reports liveness (recorded by HlsLivenessRecorder), a *subsequent* play of the same URL
 * routes correctly: a known on-demand stream is cached, a known live stream never is.
 *
 * A URL is permanently one or the other, and the recorder overwrites with the latest verdict on
 * every timeline change, so a transient early value self-corrects. Backed by a bounded, thread-safe
 * [LruCache] (same convention as [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.MediaAspectRatioCache]) so a long
 * feed session over many distinct URLs can't grow it without bound — an evicted entry just relearns
 * on its next play, which is one uncached play, the same negligible cost as a process restart.
