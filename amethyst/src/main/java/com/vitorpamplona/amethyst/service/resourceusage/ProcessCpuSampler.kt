 * Samples whole-process CPU time (user+system, [Process.getElapsedCpuTime])

 * everything that runs on the CPU — event parsing, signature verification,
 * coroutines, recomposition — without per-subsystem guesswork. Sampled from
 * the accountant's pre-flush hook, so it costs one syscall per flush and
 * nothing while idle. Per-process monotonic: a fresh process simply starts a
