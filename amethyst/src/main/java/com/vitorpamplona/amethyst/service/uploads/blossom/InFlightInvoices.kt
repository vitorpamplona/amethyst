/**
 * BOLT-11 invoices handed to the NIP-47 wallet whose fate we never learned.
 *
 * [BlossomPaymentHandler.pay] waits a bounded time for the wallet to reply, but
 * NIP-47 has no "cancel this pay_invoice": the request is fire-and-forget, so
 * giving up on the wait does **not** stop the payment. An invoice that settles a
 * second after we time out still moved the user's money — and if we then let the
 * user (or an automatic retry) send the very same invoice again, they pay twice.
 *
 * So: claim the invoice before sending it, and release the claim only when the
 * wallet gives a definitive answer. A timed-out invoice stays claimed for the
 * life of the process and can never be paid a second time from this app.
 *
 * This is the weaker half of the fix — a genuine cancel would be better, but the
 * NIP-47 client offers none, so we settle for "never silently pay it twice".
