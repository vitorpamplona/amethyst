/**
 * Diagnostic for "which account is bringing which relays into the DM filters". For each DM
 * subscription it prints the account whose relays are used and breaks the relay set down by the
 * source list each relay comes from (NIP-65 inbox/outbox, the DM-relay-list, the private-storage
 * outbox, local relays). Use it to trace an unexpected relay — e.g. a write-only NIP-65 relay that
 * only the NIP-04 (home+dm) path queries — back to the list it leaks in from.
