/**
 * The verdict to store for an HLS URL given the player's current window, or null to store nothing.
 *
 * The recording is deliberately asymmetric. A wrong "live" only forgoes caching, while a wrong
 * "on-demand" caches a live stream and breaks it (PlaylistStuck), so live is cheap to record and
 * on-demand must be earned:
 *
 * - record **live** as soon as any window says so ([allowOnDemand] irrelevant), but
 * - record **on-demand** only when [allowOnDemand] (the player reached STATE_READY, i.e. it is
 *   actually playing, not a geo-blocked stream that served a VOD-shaped placeholder playlist and
 *   then errored), the window is a resolved static finite seekable VOD, and the URL is not already
 *   known live.
 *
 * Recording on-demand only at READY is what keeps a broken/geo-fenced live stream — which reports a
 * static window from a timeline event but 403/404s before it can ever reach READY — from being
 * mislearned as cacheable. Pure, so the classification is unit-testable without a [Player].
