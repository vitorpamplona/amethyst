// The subscription filter carries `#e: [request id]` plus `#p: [client pubkey]`.
// The `#p` field is the routing key for purpose-built NWC relays (e.g.
// relay.getalby.com/v1) — dropping it caused those relays to silently never
// deliver the response. `authors` is intentionally left out because some
// wallets sign responses with a key different from the URI-advertised one.
