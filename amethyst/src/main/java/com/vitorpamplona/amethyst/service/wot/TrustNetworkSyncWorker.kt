/**
 * Keeps every loaded account's Web of Trust network index current while the app is not in use:
 * once a day, on an unmetered network with enough battery, it runs whatever sync is due (the
 * weekly negentropy full check, a small update, or a pending first download).
 *
 * Opening the app does the same for the active account (see AppModules), so this is the
 * safety net for accounts that only receive push notifications.
