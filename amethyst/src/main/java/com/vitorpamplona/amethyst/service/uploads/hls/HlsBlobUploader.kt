/**
 * Abstraction over a blob upload transport so the HLS publish orchestrator can stay
 * unit-testable. Production wiring adapts this to either
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.uploads.nip96.Nip96Uploader] or
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.uploads.blossom.BlossomUploader]. The HLS orchestrator
 * wraps this in an [com.davotoula.lightcompressor.hls.HlsUploaded]-returning lambda for
 * [com.davotoula.lightcompressor.hls.HlsUploadHelper.run]; the library itself drives the
 * per-rendition map of [MediaUploadResult]s back into
 * [com.davotoula.lightcompressor.hls.HlsUploadResult.uploads] so per-rendition sha256/size
 * can flow into the NIP-71 event's imeta tags.
 *
 * The optional [onProgress] callback is invoked as bytes flow to the wire so the UI can show
 * a smooth per-file progress bar instead of the coarse "file N of M" counter. Callers that
 * don't need byte progress pass nothing — the default is a no-op.
