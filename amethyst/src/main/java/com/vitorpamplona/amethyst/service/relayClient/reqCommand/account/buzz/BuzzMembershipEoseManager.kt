/**
 * Always-on read of the Buzz relay's membership notifications addressed to me (`#p` = me) across every
 * joined workspace — the events behind the "somebody added you to a channel" prompts and behind Buzz DM
 * discovery.
 *
 * On a Buzz relay membership is server-side: another member issues the add, the relay writes me into the
 * channel's kind-39002 roster, and then addresses me a kind-44100 naming the actor. There is no queryable
 * channel list, so this `#p`-gated stream *is* the enumeration; the matching kind-44101 withdraws one.
 *
 * ### Why its own subscription
 *
 * This filter is channel-less by nature — it is the query that *discovers* which channels exist for me,
 * so there is no `#h` to scope it with. `block/buzz` downgrades any subscription carrying a channel-less
 * (or multi-channel) filter to "global", a class that by design never receives channel-scoped events;
 * that is exactly why NIP-29 group activity was moved out of
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.relayClient.reqCommand.account.nip01Notifications.AccountNotificationsEoseFromInboxRelaysManager]
 * and onto the per-channel tails. Global is the correct class for 44100/44101 — they are stored globally
 * so their target can find them — but only as long as nothing channel-scoped shares the subscription. So
 * these ride a manager of their own rather than joining the inbox notification filters.
 *
 * Also note the relays: workspace relays are not the account's `notificationRelays`, so the inbox manager
 * would not query them even if the filter class allowed it.
 *
 * ### Auth
 *
 * The read is `#p`-gated, so the relay answers `auth-required:`. A joined workspace is first-party, so
 * each one is pre-approved on the account's auth ledger here — the restore-from-disk path doesn't set
 * that, unlike the invite/import/console entry points. [com.vitorpamplona.quartz.nip01Core.relay.client.auth.RelayAuthenticator]
 * re-signs on the refusal using the connection's stored challenge and the OK re-drives the REQ, so the
 * subscription recovers on its own rather than needing a warm-auth one-shot fetch.
