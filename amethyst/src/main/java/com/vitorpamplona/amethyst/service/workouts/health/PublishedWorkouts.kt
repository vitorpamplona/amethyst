/**
 * The workouts [pubkeyHex] has published, as a live view of the cache.
 *
 * Shared by the My Fitness dashboard, which counts them, and the New Workout carousel, which uses
 * them to avoid offering a workout the user already shared. Both need the same view of "what have
 * I already posted", and two answers to that question would mean the carousel offering something
 * the dashboard knows is a duplicate.
 *
 * [LocalCache.observeEvents] rather than a scan: it is indexed by kind and author, so it neither
 * walks every note in the cache nor needs re-running on a timer — the dashboard updates itself
 * when a relay delivers a workout, including the one the user just published.
 *
 * Reports only what the cache holds; it issues no REQ of its own.
