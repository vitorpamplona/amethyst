/**
 * Samples the device battery level at each ledger flush and accumulates the
 * drops that happen while discharging into [UsageKeys.BATTERY_DRAIN_FG] /
 * [UsageKeys.BATTERY_DRAIN_BG] (percent points, attributed by visibility at
 * sample time). This is deliberately NOT app-isolated — it's the measured
 * ground truth that lets the developers correlate the app's own counters
 * against real drain across many reports, which is how the alert thresholds
 * get tuned.
 *
 * Intervals touching a charging state (at either endpoint) are skipped, and
 * a level that went UP just resets the baseline. Piggybacks on the pre-flush
 * hook — one BatteryManager binder read per flush, nothing while idle.
