/**
 * Drop-in replacement for Coil's `AnimatedImageDecoder.Factory` that stops asking for the GIF
 * frame-delay rewrite when the file does not need it.
 *
 * The sniffing is identical to Coil's. The one difference: below API 34 Coil wraps every GIF in a
 * stream-backed `FrameDelayRewritingSource` to clamp sub-threshold frame delays, and a
 * stream-backed source has no file for `ImageDecoder` to read, so the decode falls back to
 * squashing the whole encoded animation into RAM (see [SystemFileSystemFetcher] for what that
 * costs). Nearly every GIF comes out of that rewriter byte-for-byte identical, so
 * [hasSubThresholdGifFrameDelay] checks first and the rewrite is requested only for the files
 * that would actually change.
