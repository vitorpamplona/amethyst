/**
 * Combines Health Connect exercise sessions that belong to the same real-world
 * effort. Watches, Strava, and auto-pause features often split one long workout —
 * a 5-hour run with coffee/water breaks — into several back-to-back
 * `ExerciseSessionRecord`s of the same type. Posting each break as its own
 * workout is noise; the user wants the whole run as one thing.
 *
 * [mergeCloseWorkouts] walks the sessions in start-time order and joins any run
 * of same-type sessions whose consecutive gap (start of the next minus the end of
 * the previous) is under [DEFAULT_MAX_GAP_SECONDS] into a single [DetectedWorkout]:
 * distance, calories, steps, elevation and duration are summed, heart rate is
 * duration-weighted, max heart rate is the max, and [DetectedWorkout.sessionCount]
 * records how many sessions were folded in.
 *
 * Sessions of a different type occurring between two same-type sessions do not
 * break the chain — a brief cross-training block mid-run still lets the two run
 * segments merge — because gaps are tracked per exercise type.
