/**
 * The account's NIP-60 wallet and NIP-61 nutzap inbox.
 *
 * This used to run from a collector inside `CashuWalletState`, on the account's own scope, which made
 * the wallet the only account-level subscription whose lifetime was decided by the model rather than
 * by a mount. It ran for every [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.Account] object that happened to be
 * resident — including accounts loaded purely so pushed gift wraps could be decrypted, which have no
 * wallet anyone is looking at — and the attempt to fix that bolted a "is this pubkey subscribed
 * anywhere" flow onto the model, so a model object was reading the relay layer's bookkeeping to
 * decide whether to talk to relays.
 *
 * As a manager in [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.relayClient.reqCommand.account.AccountFilterAssembler]'s
 * group it starts and stops with every other account-level loader: the screen's mount for the account
 * on show, the registry for the rest, and whatever the foreground/background rule becomes without this
 * having to know about it. Exactly how NWC already worked.
 *
 * Per user, never merged: each account's wallet reads its own outbox for its own events and its own
 * inbox for nutzaps addressed to it, so there is no shared query to fold them into.
