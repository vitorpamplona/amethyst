/**
 * Counter-key grammar for the resource-usage ledger. Keys are flat strings so
 * the on-disk store is schema-free — adding a counter never needs a migration.
 *
 * Dimensions:
 *  - network: `mobile` (cellular/metered) vs `wifi` (everything else)
 *  - visibility: `fg` (an activity is started) vs `bg`
 *  - direction: `rx` (downloaded) vs `tx` (uploaded)
 *
 * Counters are sizes, durations, and counts only — never content, and never a
 * full URL, and never a relay name.
 * See plans/2026-07-12-resource-usage-ledger.md.
 *
 * ## Reserved segments — read before adding a counter
 *
 * [sumMatching] matches by dot-segment *membership*, not by prefix, and every
 * headline figure in [UsageSummary] is built from it. A new key that happens to
 * contain one of these segments silently joins that sum:
 *
 *     rx  tx  msg  connms  connects  connfails  reqs  bursts  activems
 *     worker  runs  + every value in [HTTP_ROLES]
 *
 * Concretely: a key named `relay.rx.event.mobile.bg` would be counted by
 * `traffic(MOBILE, BG)` *in addition to* `relay.msg.mobile.bg.rx`, doubling the
 * reported data usage and halving the effective threshold of the
 * background-mobile-data alert. That is why the relay verb split below uses
 * `up`/`down` rather than `tx`/`rx`.
 *
 * `ResourceUsageLedgerTest.newKeysDoNotDisturbSummary` is the regression guard:
 * it asserts [UsageSummary.from] is value-identical with and without every key
 * this object can produce.
