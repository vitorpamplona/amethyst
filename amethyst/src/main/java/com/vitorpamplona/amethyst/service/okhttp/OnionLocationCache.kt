/**
 * Maps clearnet hostnames to their advertised .onion equivalents, populated
 * passively by [OnionLocationInterceptor] from any HTTP/WebSocket response
 * that carries an `Onion-Location` header.
 *
 * The [OnionUrlRewriteInterceptor] consults this cache on every outbound
 * request when Tor is active, transparently redirecting to the .onion address
 * so Tor-routed connections avoid exit nodes entirely.
 *
 * Entries expire after [TTL_MS] so that a server that rotates or decommissions
 * its `.onion` address does not permanently break Tor connectivity. After expiry
 * the next request goes out via Tor exit nodes (or clearnet on the no-proxy
 * client); if the server still advertises `Onion-Location` the mapping is
 * refreshed automatically.
