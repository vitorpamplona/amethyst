 *
 * Coil wraps every GIF in that rewriting source on API < 34 (the platform clamps sub-threshold
 * delays itself from 34 on). The wrapper is stream-backed, which costs the file fast path in
 * [onSystemFileSystem] and forces the whole encoded animation into RAM twice. The overwhelming
 * majority of GIFs declare a sane delay and come out of the rewriter byte-for-byte identical,
 * so this scan buys the fast path back for them and leaves the rewrite in place only for the
 * files that need it.
 *
 * The condition matches Coil's exactly (verified against Coil 3.5.0): a delay below the
 * threshold in a block whose terminator byte is zero. Reading the whole stream costs one
 * sequential pass over a [SCAN_CHUNK] buffer and allocates nothing else, against the
 * file-sized heap **and** direct-buffer copies the rewrite path would otherwise make.
