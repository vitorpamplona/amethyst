/**
 * Accounts actual media playback time into the resource-usage ledger.
 * Playback is one of the most energy-dense things the app does — decoder,
 * screen, and streaming all at once — and this turns "video used 800 MB"
 * into "800 MB over 2h of playback" (normal) vs "over 10 minutes" (a bug).
 *
 * Attached once per player in [ExoPlayerBuilder]; a player released
 * mid-playback loses at most its final open segment.
