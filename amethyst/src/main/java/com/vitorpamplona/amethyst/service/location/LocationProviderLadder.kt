import android.location.LocationManager
import android.os.Build

/**
 * Picks which location providers to try, in order.
 *
 * Deliberately selects on **provider existence**, never on
 * [LocationManager.isProviderEnabled]. A registration on a disabled provider
 * goes live by itself when the user enables location — including from the
 * quick-settings shade without leaving the app, which is exactly what someone
 * does after seeing an empty "Around Me" feed. An enabled-state guard evaluated
 * once at subscription start would lose that.
 *
 * Below API 31, `gps`, `passive` and `fused` required `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`;
 * only `network` accepted `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`. Approximate location, which
 * lets a coarse-only app request any provider and receive a fuzzed result, is an
 * Android 12 change. Amethyst declares coarse only, so the legacy branch is
 * unconditional below API 31.
 *
 * Adding `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` later would **not** widen this on its own — the
 * branch below has no permission input, so pre-31 devices would keep getting
 * `network` alone and silently lose the precision the new permission was granted
 * for. Whoever adds it must widen the condition here too.
 *
 * Returns the ordered candidate list rather than a single choice so the caller
 * can fall through to the next rung if a registration is refused. An empty list
 * means no compatible provider exists.
