package com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.resourceusage

/**
 * Refcounts a boolean session so overlapping holders don't close each other's
 * segment. [LocationState][com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.location.LocationState]
 * exposes two independent location flows that can both be listening at once —
 * the "Around Me" feed plus an open geohash chat — and a bare
 * [SessionTimeIntegrator] would close the segment when either one stops.
 *
 * The count and the transition it drives are taken under one lock. An
 * [java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger] beside an unsynchronised call is
 * not enough: two threads can leave the counter at 1 while the last
 * `setActive(false)` lands after the `setActive(true)`, latching the session
 * off with a holder still active.
 *
 * Takes the setter as a lambda rather than a [SessionTimeIntegrator] because
 * that is all it needs — and because constructing a real integrator drags in a
 * [ResourceUsageAccountant] and a store file to observe one boolean.
 *
 * Reports **transitions only**, not every call. A 1 -> 2 acquire would otherwise
 * re-enter [SessionTimeIntegrator.setActive] with the session already open,
 * splitting one segment into two. That happens to be arithmetically harmless
 * (`account()` adds each piece, and the pieces are contiguous), and it does not
 * inflate a `*.starts` counter either, because [SessionTimeIntegrator] already
 * guards its starts increment on `prev == null`. Transition-only is simply the
 * contract the name implies, and it keeps the class honest for a future caller
 * that reacts to the callback rather than integrating it.
 *
 * Releases must be paired with acquires. This class cannot tell an unpaired
 * release from a real one, so callers guarantee the pairing; see `LocationFlow`,
 * which throws rather than reaching `awaitClose` when nothing registered.
