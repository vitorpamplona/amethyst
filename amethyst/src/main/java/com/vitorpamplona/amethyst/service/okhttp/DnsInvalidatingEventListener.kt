/**
 * Drops a host's [SurgeDns] entry whenever an OkHttp call to it fails outright. We hook
 * `callFailed` (final-stage signal after OkHttp has tried every address from the DNS lookup)
 * rather than per-attempt `connectFailed`: a multi-A-record host with one bad IP fires the
 * latter while OkHttp recovers via the next address, and we don't want to invalidate the cache
 * just because the first IP was unreachable.
 *
 * A failure caused by the DNS LOOKUP ITSELF ([UnknownHostException]) must NOT invalidate:
 * this hook exists to drop STALE POSITIVES (rotated IPs that no longer connect), but for a
 * resolution failure the freshly-written negative entry IS the useful cache state — deleting
 * it milliseconds after creation re-pays the full 10-30s resolver timeout on every re-dial
 * and silently defeats the negative TTL entirely.
 *
 * Used by the relay client. The media path uses [MediaCallEventListener], which folds the same
 * invalidation into its `finish` method alongside its existing timing logging.
