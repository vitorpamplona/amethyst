/**
 * Loads the account's NIP-60 spending **history** (kind:7376) by **`until`+`limit` paging, per relay, on
 * demand**, so the wallet's transaction list can be scrolled back through a wallet's whole lifetime
 * instead of showing whatever suffix one uncapped REQ happened to return.
 *
 * ### Why history needs its own loader
 *
 * [CashuWalletEoseManager] opens one live subscription per outbox relay covering six kinds at once, with
 * no `limit`. A relay answers that with its own cap applied to the newest matching events, and history
 * rows are the most numerous kind in the query — so on a wallet with a few hundred transactions the list
 * is truncated to a recent-N view that differs per device, and no later REQ ever asks for the rest (the
 * EOSE moves `since` forward). That is the same truncation that was silently costing balance, except
 * here the fix is paging rather than a one-shot walk: history is display-only and unbounded, so pulling
 * all of it at launch would be a large download for something the user may never scroll.
 *
 * ### How it pages
 *
 * There is no proactive walk. Each relay advances exactly one page when the transaction list asks
 * ([advance] / [advanceAll]), then **parks** — a relay that finished a page keeps the same `until` in
 * [updateFilter], so re-assembly triggered by *another* relay advancing does not re-REQ it. The list is
 * the driver: it pulls a page on open and another whenever the user scrolls near the end, so nothing is
 * fetched while the wallet is off screen.
 *
 * Paged over the account's **outbox** relays — the same set the wallet publishes its own events to, and
 * so the same set [CashuWalletEoseManager] reads its own kinds back from.
 *
 * ### Floor: no live tail
 *
 * The DM/notification pagers floor at `now − liveTail` because a separate live loader is known to cover
 * everything newer. The wallet has no such guarantee: its live REQ carries no `since` and no `limit`, so
 * how far back it actually reaches is whatever the relay decided — which is the very thing being fixed
 * here. Flooring at a fixed tail would therefore leave a gap between the relay's cap and the tail
 * boundary that neither loader ever asks for. So this pager floors at **now** and overlaps the live
 * subscription completely; duplicates cost nothing (both `LocalCache` and `CashuWalletState.historyEvents`
 * are keyed by event id) and gaplessness is worth more than the overlap.
 *
 * The per-relay cursors live on the [Account] (so they share the account's lifetime); this class binds
 * the single-active [BackwardRelayPager] to them on [newSub], builds the REQ filters, and forwards relay
 * callbacks into the pager. A relay is *done* once it answers an empty page; one that will not answer
 * (auth CLOSE, unreachable, silent) is flagged *stalled* but kept, and [PagingStatus.exhausted] flips
 * once every relay is done or stalled — callers rendering a terminal state should split on
 * [PagingStatus.stalledCount].
