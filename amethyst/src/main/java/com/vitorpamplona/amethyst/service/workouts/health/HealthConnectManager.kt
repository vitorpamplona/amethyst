     * wrong — a distance cell is missing until it is known, not shown as 0.

     * A single-emission caller that wants the finished numbers takes [readWorkouts].

     * did: [WorkoutMerger] sums the members' metrics, so aggregating a merged span instead would
     * fold in the breaks between segments and change the totals.

     * fails.
