/**
 * Publishes what the user is listening to, in Amethyst or in another app, as the logged-in
 * account's NIP-38 music status, following that account's now-playing settings.
 *
 * App-scoped, like the other background watchers in AppModules: the music keeps playing (and
 * other apps keep reporting) after the activity is gone. While the app is in the background the
 * relay pool is paused, so every publish holds [relayServices] open for [RELAY_HOLD_MS], long
 * enough for the event to go out.
