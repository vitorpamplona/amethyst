/**
 * okio [FileSystem] wrapper that moves Coil's eviction `unlink()` out from
 * under the `DiskLruCache` lock.
 *
 * Verified against Coil 3.4.0's `coil3.disk.DiskLruCache`: eviction is not
 * inline on the commit thread — `completeEdit()` calls `launchCleanup()`,
 * which `launch`es on a limited-parallelism IO scope. But the cleanup
 * coroutine runs `trimToSize()` *while holding the global `DiskLruCache`
 * lock*, and `trimToSize()` → `removeEntry()` → `fileSystem.delete()` does
 * the unlink syscalls under that lock. Every `openSnapshot()` (read) and
 * `openEditor()` (write) contends on the same lock. So on a saturated
 * cache, each cleanup pass blocks all feed-scroll reads and writes for the
 * duration of a burst of `delete()` syscalls — that is the scroll stall
 * users see go away after a storage wipe.
 *
 * This wrapper intercepts `delete()` — exactly the call `removeEntry()`
 * makes — and, instead of unlinking inline, enqueues the path and unlinks
 * it later on a background coroutine, one path at a time with a `yield()`
 * between each so the IO dispatcher stays responsive. `delete()` returns in
 * microseconds, so `trimToSize()` releases the lock almost immediately;
 * Coil keeps full ownership of LRU order, keys, and `size` accounting, and
 * only the syscall is rescheduled off-lock.
 *
 * Re-create race: if Coil re-fetches a URL whose entry was just evicted, it
 * writes a new file at the same path. [atomicMove], [sink], [appendingSink],
 * [openReadWrite] and [createDirectory] therefore cancel any pending delete
 * of the path they are about to (re)create, so the drainer can never unlink
 * a freshly written file.
 *
 * The drainer unlinks each path while holding [lock], so a concurrent
 * write-path call that needs to cancel a delete waits at most one in-flight
 * `unlink()` — O(1), never the O(N) burst this class exists to remove.
 *
 * This instance is dedicated to Coil's image disk cache, so every path it
 * sees is a cache file and deferring all `delete()` calls is safe.
