/**
 * WorkManager periodic worker that catches up on missed notifications.
 *
 * This runs every 15 minutes (WorkManager's minimum interval) and ensures
 * relay connections are active. It acts as a safety net:
 *
 * - If the foreground service was killed by an OEM battery optimizer, this
 *   worker will briefly restore connections and pull missed events.
 * - If the foreground service is running fine, this worker is essentially a no-op
 *   since the connections are already live and filters are active.
 *
 * The worker collects relayServices to ensure connections are active,
 * waits briefly for data to flow, then exits. The foreground service
 * (if alive) handles the persistent connection.
