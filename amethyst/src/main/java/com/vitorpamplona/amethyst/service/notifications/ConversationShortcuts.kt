/**
 * The long-lived shortcut that turns a MessagingStyle notification into an actual
 * *conversation* as far as the system is concerned.
 *
 * MessagingStyle on its own is only half the contract. Since Android 11 the shade sorts a
 * notification into the Conversations section — and offers the per-conversation controls
 * that come with it (mark a person Priority, silence one room without silencing every DM) —
 * only when the notification names a **long-lived shortcut** through `setShortcutId`.
 * Without one it is ranked as an ordinary alerting notification, which is what every DM,
 * group message and Buzz room got before this existed, despite the KDoc claiming otherwise.
 *
 * The same shortcut is the prerequisite for two things worth having later: bubbles
 * (`setBubbleMetadata`) and Direct Share targets. Neither is wired yet.
 *
 * ### What gets published
 *
 * One shortcut per conversation, keyed by [NotificationUtils.Conversation.id] — which
 * includes the account, so the same counterparty under two logins does not collapse into one
 * launcher entry pointing at the wrong inbox. The intent is the same deep link the
 * notification taps through ([NotificationRoutes]), so the launcher entry and the tap agree.
 *
 * ### Why this is gated on a setting
 *
 * A dynamic shortcut is visible in the launcher's long-press menu: publishing one puts a
 * contact's name and avatar outside the app, where someone holding the phone can read it
 * without unlocking anything of ours. That is the disclosure `showMessagesInNotifications`
 * exists to control, so callers pass [NotificationUtils.Conversation] only when it is on.

    /**
     * Publishes (or refreshes) the conversation's shortcut and returns its id, or null when

     *
     * Null matters: a `setShortcutId` pointing at a shortcut that does not exist is worse
     * than none — the system logs it and still refuses the conversation treatment — so the
     * caller must only stamp the notification when this succeeded.
     *
     * [ShortcutManagerCompat.pushDynamicShortcut] already handles the two things that bite
     * here: it evicts the least-recently-used shortcut when the per-activity cap is reached,
     * and it is rate-limit aware. It can still throw on a malformed shortcut, so the whole
     * call is guarded — a conversation that cannot be published is a notification that
     * renders normally, never a crash on the notification path.
