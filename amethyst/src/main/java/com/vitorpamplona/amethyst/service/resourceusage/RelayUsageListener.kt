/**
 * Counts relay websocket traffic into the usage ledger. Frame sizes are
 * UTF-16 char counts of the JSON payload — a close proxy for on-wire bytes
 * (relay JSON is ASCII-dominant), consistent with how RelayStats counts.
 * Excludes WS framing/compression; good enough for "which subsystem is
 * eating my data plan" comparisons.
 *
 * Beyond the byte totals this also carries the relay-churn diagnostics: a
 * per-verb split of those same bytes, a connection-lifetime histogram, and
 * per-relay failure/short-session counts. See
 * plans/2026-07-29-relay-churn-diagnostics.md for what each answers and how to
 * read them together.
 *
 * The verb split takes its name straight from the wire label the command already
 * knows (`Command.label()` / `Message.label()`), so `Σ verb == Σ msg` holds by
 * construction and a new subtype needs no change here.
