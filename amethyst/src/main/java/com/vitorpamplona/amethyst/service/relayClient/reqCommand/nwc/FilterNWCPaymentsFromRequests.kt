// The request event id (#e) is a unique 32-byte identifier — sufficient on
// its own to match a spec-compliant kind-23195 response. We deliberately keep
// `authors` out of the filter because some wallet services route through a
// signer pubkey that differs from the one advertised in the connection URI,
// which made the previous `authors`-strict filter time out.
//
// We DO keep `#p: [client pubkey]` because purpose-built NWC relays
// (e.g. relay.getalby.com/v1) use the `#p` tag as the routing key — without
// it the relay never delivers the response to our subscription, even though
// the event is well-formed. Spec-compliant responses always set `p` to the
// client pubkey, so including `#p` does not exclude any conforming wallet.
// The wallet's identity is still authenticated end-to-end by NIP-04
// decryption against the per-connection shared secret AND by a client-side
// `event.pubKey == request.p` check in NwcPaymentTracker.
