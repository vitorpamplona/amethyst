     * never fires again (the later `event = copyNoContent()` is a plain assignment).

     * always-on one-week gift-wrap tail re-delivers and re-unwraps the envelope on every
     * cold start, so a push-recent message always comes back on its own. This URI is read
     * only by `MainActivity.uriToRoute`, inside our own process, and the route it produces
