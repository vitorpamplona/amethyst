/**
 * In-memory hot path for usage counters. [add] is called from network threads
 * per relay frame / HTTP response chunk, so it must be allocation-light and
 * lock-free: a ConcurrentHashMap of AtomicLongs, drained into
 * [ResourceUsageStore] by a debounced flush (at most one write per
 * [flushDebounceMs] while traffic flows; nothing scheduled when idle).
 *
 * AtomicLong (not LongAdder) because draining must be loss-free: getAndSet(0)
 * hands off the accumulated value atomically, whereas remove+sum on a
 * LongAdder can strand a racing increment on an orphaned cell. Entries stay
 * in the map after a drain — the key space is small and fixed (dims x areas),
 * so this costs a few hundred boxed zeros at most.
 *
 * Counters added from inside a pre-flush hook (the CPU sampler, the segment
 * integrators closing an open segment) never re-arm the debounce: they are
 * drained by the very flush that invoked the hook, and letting them schedule
 * would turn every flush into a perpetual 30s wake-and-write loop — the
 * battery ledger becoming its own battery drain.
 *
 * Day attribution: deltas are drained into the bucket of the day they are
 * drained on. Counts within one debounce window of midnight may land on the
 * neighboring day — irrelevant at the ledger's day-level granularity.
