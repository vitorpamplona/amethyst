/**
 * Posts tray notifications for non-zap Lightning payments reported by the logged-in
 * account's connected NWC wallets.
 *
 * The relay subscription that receives these events is NOT here — it lives in
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.relayClient.reqCommand.account.nip47WalletConnect.NwcNotificationsEoseManager],
 * grouped with the account's always-on zap/notification inbox subscriptions so it
 * shares their lifecycle (open while logged in, warm in the background). That
 * manager decrypts each notification and publishes non-zap payments to
 * `NwcSignerState.incomingNonZapPayments`; this class is only the Context-bound
 * bridge that drains that flow into an OS notification.
 *
 * Keeping decode and display decoupled means the flow stays populated even when OS
 * notifications are denied (a future in-app Notifications-tab consumer can drain
 * the same flow); [NwcPaymentNotifier] itself is what no-ops when the tray is off.
