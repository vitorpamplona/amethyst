 * distinguish "8 h of video" from "8 h of feeds".

 * navigation arguments before anything reaches the ledger) — "Profile" is
 * tracked, whose profile never is. Time only accrues while the app is in the
 * foreground: the current-route × foreground combination is the segment
 * state, so backgrounding on a screen closes its segment.
