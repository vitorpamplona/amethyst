/**
 * The morning edition on Android: one unique WorkManager job per account, due at the next
 * occurrence of the synced schedule's cron in its zone, network-constrained, and only where the
 * reader turned on "Print from this device" ([FrontPageScheduleWatcher] cancels it otherwise).
 * Which of the reader's devices prints an occurrence is decided by its claim, in the run.
 * WorkManager keeps it across reboots. Each run schedules the next, after itself.
 *
 * The job that waits and the print that runs are kept apart: a reschedule never replaces a job
 * that is running (that would cancel a paid print), and a job already waiting for the same
 * instant is left alone (every cold start reschedules), so it is replaced only when the time
 * changed. The instant a job waits for is in its tags.
