/**
 * Mounts the account-level loaders — notifications, DMs, gift wraps, drafts,
 * metadata — for accounts that have no screen of their own.
 *
 * Every other mount of [AccountFilterAssembler] comes from a composable holding an
 * `AccountViewModel`, which means it only ever covers the account the user is
 * looking at. Every other logged-in account was merely resident in memory so pushed
 * gift wraps could be decrypted by their owner; everything else about them depended
 * on a push message arriving. On a device with no push (no Play Services, no
 * UnifiedPush distributor, Pokey not installed) they pulled nothing at all.
 *
 * This registry is the pull side. It holds one [AccountQueryState] per account it is
 * given and drives [AccountFilterAssembler.subscribe] /
 * [AccountFilterAssembler.unsubscribe] directly — those are plain functions, not
 * composables, so no UI has to exist.
 *
 * The keys carry no feed states (see [AccountQueryState.feedContentStates]) and no
 * `otherAccounts` — populating the account switcher's avatars is a screen's job, and
 * these accounts have no screen.
 *
 * It deliberately decides nothing about *which* accounts those are: it mounts exactly
 * the set it is handed, so the foreground/background rule lives in one place, in
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.notifications.AlwaysOnNotificationServiceManager],
 * which already watches the switches that define it and calls [sync] on every change.
