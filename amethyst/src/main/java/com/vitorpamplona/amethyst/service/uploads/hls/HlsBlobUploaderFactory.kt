/**
 * Turns a user-chosen [ServerName] into an [HlsBlobUploader] by adapting the concrete
 * [Nip96Uploader] / [BlossomUploader] to the simpler file+contentType interface the HLS upload
 * pipeline uses. Keeps the pipeline free of direct Amethyst/account wiring so it stays
 * unit-testable.
 *
 * HLS uploads get a dedicated OkHttp client derived from the shared upload client: write and
 * read timeouts are disabled so a slow rendition trickling through at a few hundred KB/s is
 * not killed mid-stream, and server-side hashing/scanning that blocks the response for minutes
 * does not fire the read timeout while the request is still in flight. A generous per-call
 * timeout remains in place as a hard cap so a silently dead connection eventually errors out.
