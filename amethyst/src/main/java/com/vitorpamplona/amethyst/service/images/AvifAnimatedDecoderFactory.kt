/**
 * Coil [Decoder.Factory] for AVIF (still and animated).
 *
 * Coil's bundled [AnimatedImageDecoder.Factory] only accepts HEIF brands (msf1/hevc/hevx)
 * at offset 8, so it misses AVIF, whose major brand at offset 8 is "avis" (animated AVIF
 * Image Sequence), "avif" (still AVIF), or "avo1" (older single-image AVIF). Without this
 * factory, animated AVIFs fall through to Coil's default static decoder and render as
 * the first frame only.
 *
 * On API 31+, the platform [android.graphics.ImageDecoder] produces an
 * [android.graphics.drawable.AnimatedImageDrawable] for animated AVIF. We delegate the
 * actual decode to Coil's [AnimatedImageDecoder] — only the brand sniff is custom.
 *
 * Below API 31 the platform decoder cannot handle AVIF at all, so we decline and let
 * other decoders try (they will also fail, and Coil falls through to its error slot,
 * which is the documented behavior for unsupported formats on older API levels).
