/**
 * Coordinates all 5 layers of the always-on notification system:
 *
 * L1 - NotificationRelayService (foreground service with persistent WebSocket)
 * L2 - FCM/UnifiedPush (existing push system, wakeup trigger)
 * L3 - NotificationCatchUpWorker (WorkManager, 15-min periodic catch-up)
 * L4 - BootCompletedReceiver (restart on boot)
 * L5 - ServiceWatchdogManager (AlarmManager, 5-min health check)
 *
 * It also decides **which accounts pull from relays**, which is a different question from
 * whether the service runs, and the two are deliberately not gated the same way.
 *
 * ## Who subscribes
 *
 * - **While a screen is up: every loaded account.** The user can switch accounts at any moment
 *   and expects the one they land on to be current, so all of them keep their own notifications,
 *   DMs and gift wraps live. This costs nothing once the app is away — it ends with the screen.
 * - **While the app is away: only the accounts that opted in**, via
 *   [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.AccountSettings.alwaysOnNotificationService] ("Keep this
 *   account active in the background") or their NIP-46 signer toggle
 *   ([com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.AccountSettings.nip46SignerEnabled]).
 *
 * That is what the setting's name promises, and for a while it did not hold: participation gated
 * subscriptions everywhere, so an account you had not opted in for showed no notifications even
 * with the app open in front of you.
 *
 * ## Whether the service runs
 *
 * The five layers are a background concern, so they stay gated on **both** the global master
 * ([LocalPreferences.notificationServiceEnabledFlow], the "Background notification service"
 * toggle / Quick Settings tile — the battery-saver "airplane mode", persisted so an explicit off
 * survives restarts) **and** at least one account having opted in. A foreground-only account must
 * never start a foreground service that outlives the screen that wanted it.
 *
 * Every saved writable account is kept loaded in [AccountCacheState] whenever either condition
 * holds, so (a) participation flags are observable and (b) GiftWraps addressed to any of them get
 * unwrapped by the owning account's `newNotesPreProcessor`. Without this, wraps for non-active
 * accounts would sit in [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.LocalCache] with no subscriber able to
 * decrypt them.
