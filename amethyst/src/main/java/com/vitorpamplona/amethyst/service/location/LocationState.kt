/**
 * Turns the device's location into geohashes, listening **only while the app is
 * in the foreground**.
 *
 * The gate is not an optimisation of last resort: `Account` builds 30
 * `SharingStarted.Eagerly` top-nav filter states on the account scope, and
 * `AccountSettings.defaultProductsFollowList` ships as `TopFilter.AroundMe`, so
 * without it every user with location permission holds a registration for the
 * life of the process. See `amethyst/plans/2026-07-29-location-foreground-gate.md`.
 *
 * Switching the *consumers* to `WhileSubscribed` is not an option: roughly 60
 * call sites read `account.live*FollowLists.value` synchronously rather than
 * collecting, and would silently serve a stale or initial value.
