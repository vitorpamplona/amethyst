/**
 * Builds a stable, decorative waveform from a [seed] (usually an event id). ExoPlayer drives
 * actual playback progress — these bars only exist so an audio player has the familiar
 * "audio silhouette" shape rather than a flat strip when the source carries no `waveform` tag.
 * Shared by every audio renderer whose spec omits waveforms (music tracks, podcast episodes, …).
 *
 * Every shape parameter (phase offset, carrier frequency, baseline, envelope skew, jitter
 * envelope) is drawn from the seeded RNG before the per-bar loop, so two different seeds
 * produce visibly different waveforms — earlier versions used a fixed envelope + carrier that
 * only varied by per-bar noise, which made every track look like the same slow-fade sine with
 * minor wiggle.
