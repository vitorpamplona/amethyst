/**
 * Keeps [ScheduledPostWorker]'s 15-minute periodic chain enqueued exactly while
 * the store holds a PENDING post. An unconditionally-scheduled periodic worker
 * wakes — and often cold-starts — the whole process every 15 minutes forever,
 * even for users who never schedule a post.
 *
 * The store is durable (JSON on disk) and the single source of truth, so
 * [onPendingWork] fires from any mutation that produces a PENDING row (add,
 * publishNow, releaseClaim) and [onNoPendingWork] when the last one drains
 * (markSent/markFailed/cancel/removeForAccount).
 *
 * PUBLISHING counts as pending work: claimDuePosts flips PENDING → PUBLISHING
 * (and emits) BEFORE the worker publishes, so gating on PENDING alone would
 * cancel the periodic worker mid-publish the moment it claims the last post —
 * stranding the post in PUBLISHING with nothing left to finish or retry it.
 *
 * [start] forces the store's initial disk load BEFORE collecting: the flow's
 * initial value is an empty list until the store is first touched, and acting
 * on that placeholder would cancel scheduled work that a pending post still
 * needs.
