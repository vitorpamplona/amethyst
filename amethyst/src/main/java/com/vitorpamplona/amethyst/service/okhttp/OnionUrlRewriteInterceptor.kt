/**
 * Application interceptor that rewrites outbound requests to use a known
 * .onion address when one is available in [OnionLocationCache].
 *
 * Only added to Tor-enabled OkHttpClient instances, so .onion substitution
 * never happens on clearnet connections (where .onion DNS would not resolve).
 *
 * Scheme is derived from the `Onion-Location` header value:
 * - `http://` onion + WebSocket original → `ws://`
 * - `https://` onion + WebSocket original → `wss://`
 * - HTTP originals take the onion scheme directly
 *
 * Port and path are preserved from the onion URL and original request
 * respectively. An unparseable cached URL falls through to the original.
