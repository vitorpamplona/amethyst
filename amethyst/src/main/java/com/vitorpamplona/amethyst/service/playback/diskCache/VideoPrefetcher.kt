/**
 * Downloads the first [PREFETCH_BYTES] of the videos a feed is about to show into [videoCache], so
 * the player that opens one when its card is composed reads the start from disk instead of waiting
 * on the network for its first bytes and the container header.
 *
 * Only the head: an mp4's header and the buffer a player needs before it starts, not the whole
 * file. [WORKERS] downloads at a time, nearest the viewport first, so it never takes more than that
 * many connections from the video on screen. HLS is never sent here (its playlist and segments are
 * separate requests, and a live playlist must not be cached).
 *
 * Videos routed through Tor go one at a time even with [WORKERS] free: a Tor circuit often carries
 * only 1-2 Mbps, and two heads at once would slow the start of the video on screen, which shares it.
 *
 * A download keeps going when its card reaches the screen: that is when the player needs it, and
 * cancelling there would throw away the bytes just before they are read. Only a feed that leaves
 * (an empty list from every feed) stops the ones in flight.
