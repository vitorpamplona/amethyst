 *

 * posted [Notification], and MessagingStyle can be extracted and extended. Callers that are
 * not conversations (BigText notifications carrying an inline reply) have no thread to append
 * to and get `setRemoteInputHistory`, which is the same idea in the shape that style supports.
 *

 * the reply was in flight. Nothing is re-posted in that case: they are done with it.
