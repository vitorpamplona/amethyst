/**
 * Decides whether a BOLT12 zap the wallet refused should be re-sent as a BOLT11 zap.
 *
 * Only ever consulted for a NIP-47 *error* reply. An allowlist, because not every
 * error means no money moved: NIP-47 defines `PAYMENT_FAILED` as "may be due to a
 * timeout, exhausting all routes, insufficient capacity or similar", and a wallet
 * that gave up on a payment whose HTLC is still in flight can see it settle later.
 * Retrying on that, or on the catch-all `INTERNAL` / `OTHER` / no-code replies,
 * could pay the recipient twice. Only refusals the wallet raises *before* it
 * attempts a payment qualify — the offer could not be resolved or has expired, the
 * request was rejected as malformed, or our wallet does not handle `lno` at all.
 * Those are the "recipient's configuration is stale" cases the fallback exists for.
 * Refusals about our own wallet (balance, quota, permissions) are out too: BOLT11
 * through the same wallet would fail identically and only add a second error.
