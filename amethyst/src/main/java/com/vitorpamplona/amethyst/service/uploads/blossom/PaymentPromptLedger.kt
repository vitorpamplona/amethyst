/**
 * Bounds how often one user action may raise a BUD-07 payment prompt.
 *
 * The mirror flow retries a target after paying it, and that retry catches every
 * exception — including a second `BlossomPaymentException`. Left unbounded, a
 * server that pockets the preimage and answers 402 again drives an indefinite
 * pay-prompt cycle: pay → 402 → prompt → pay → 402 → … Each cycle is a real
 * payment, so "the user can always tap cancel" is not an adequate answer.
 *
 * Rule: a given (blob, server) pair may prompt at most once per user-initiated
 * action. [beginUserAction] resets the ledger; everything downstream of that tap
 * — including the post-payment retry — goes through [shouldPrompt].
