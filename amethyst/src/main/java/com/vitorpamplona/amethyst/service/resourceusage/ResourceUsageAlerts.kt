/**
 * Pure threshold logic for the "this app is consuming too much" prompt.
 * Thresholds are deliberately conservative: the prompt should fire for the
 * pathological cases (a stuck reconnect loop, process-restart churn, runaway
 * background sync) — not for a heavy day of normal use. Tune them as real
 * reports come in.
 *
 * Never auto-sends anything: a positive evaluation only ASKS the user, at
 * most once every [MIN_DAYS_BETWEEN_PROMPTS] days, and respects a permanent
 * opt-out. Both are persisted in [ResourceUsageStore].
