/**
 * The live notification tail, for **every** logged-in account, in one subscription.
 *
 * Notifications are `#p`-scoped, so a relay that serves several of the user's accounts can be asked
 * about all of them in one filter naming every pubkey — the query is identical in shape, only wider.
 * That is what keeps this within a relay's `max_subscriptions`: one REQ per relay instead of one per
 * (account, relay). With four accounts open, the per-account form pushed strfry relays past their
 * 20-subscription cap and they answered `ERROR: too many concurrent REQs` — a NOTICE, carrying no
 * subscription id, so the client could not even tell which REQ had been dropped. Those filters stayed
 * "live" in our books and silently never delivered.
 *
 * Gift wraps deliberately do **not** merge this way. They are unsolicited and their content is opaque
 * to the relay, so it cannot rate-limit them per recipient; a merged query would let one spammed
 * account consume the shared `limit` and starve every other account's DMs. Each account keeps its own
 * budget there — see [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.relayClient.reqCommand.account.nip59GiftWraps.AccountGiftWrapsEoseManager].
 *
 * ## The `limit` here is shared, and deliberately not scaled
 *
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.service.relayClient.reqCommand.account.metadata.AccountMetadataEoseManager]
 * multiplies its limits by the number of merged accounts; this one does not, and the difference is the
 * kind of event. Metadata is replaceable, so the limit is a safety bound and widening it costs nothing.
 * Notifications are a stream, so the limit is a page size: scaling it by four accounts would ask four
 * times the data of every relay on every cold start, and most would clamp it anyway (`max_limit` is 500
 * on strfry — already below the 2000 the summary filter asks for).
 *
 * So on a cold start a busy account can crowd a quiet one out of the shared newest-N. What recovers it
 * is [AccountNotificationsHistoryEoseManager], which pages backward per account and stays unmerged for
 * exactly that reason.
