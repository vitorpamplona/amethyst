     * rest: other clients sometimes deliver a mention to the author's own relays instead of the
     * recipient's inbox, so those only ever turn up if we go and look.
     *
     * It looks at a **rotating window of [RELAYS_PER_PASS] relays**, not at every relay the follows
     * post to. The whole set was ~330 relays on a normal account, and subscribing to all of them
     * held roughly 670 filters permanently — by a wide margin the largest thing the client ran, for
     * a job that only needs to sweep the space eventually, not watch all of it at once. The window
     * slides every [PASS_DURATION_MS], so every relay is still visited, just never all at the same
     * time.
     *
     * The window is a contiguous slice of a URL-sorted list rather than a random draw: a fresh
     * random pick on each invalidation would re-REQ a different set every few seconds, which costs
     * more than the subscriptions it replaced. Deterministic order means the window only moves when
     * the rotation timer says so.
