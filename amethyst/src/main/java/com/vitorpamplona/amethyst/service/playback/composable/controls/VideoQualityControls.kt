 * Constrains adaptive selection to the area the player is actually drawn in.
 *
 * ExoPlayer already filters renditions by a viewport, but its default viewport is the **physical
 * display** (`TrackSelectionParameters.Builder.init` sets
 * `isViewportSizeLimitedByPhysicalDisplaySize`), so every player — a thumbnail in a note, a
 * full-bleed short, a PiP window — is told it has the whole screen to fill and picks whatever
 * bandwidth allows up to display resolution. Handing it the measured size instead is the whole
 * quality policy: a full-width video gets the top of the ladder, a small one gets the rung that
 * matches its pixels, and both still adapt to the connection underneath that ceiling.
 *
 * Safe by construction, which is why this uses `setViewportSize` rather than `setMaxVideoSize`:
 * DefaultTrackSelector derives its retain threshold from an actual rendition ("the smallest to
 * exceed the maximum size at which it can be displayed within the viewport") and leaves the group
 * untouched when no rendition covers the viewport, so a tiny player can never filter every track
 * away. A manual pick from the quality menu still wins — overrides are re-applied after
 * constraint-based selection runs.
