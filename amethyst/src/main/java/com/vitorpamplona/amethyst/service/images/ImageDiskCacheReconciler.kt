/**
 * Brings the image cache directory back under its own size budget at startup.
 *
 * [DeferredDeleteFileSystem] moves Coil's eviction `unlink()` off the `DiskLruCache` lock by
 * queueing it in memory. Anything still queued when the process dies is never unlinked — and Coil
 * cannot recover it, because `DiskLruCache.processJournal()` computes `size` purely from the
 * journal's recorded lengths and never scans the directory for files it does not know about. The
 * orphan counts toward neither `size` nor eviction, so the directory keeps whatever residue every
 * killed process left behind, forever.
 *
 * Measured against the real Coil `DiskCache`: 48 unlinks lost to one process death left Coil
 * reporting 16 KB against a 16 KB budget while the directory actually held 48 KB — and reopening
 * as a fresh process reclaimed none of it.
 *
 * `DiskCache.clear()` is not enough on its own: it evicts `lruEntries`, which is exactly the set of
 * files the journal knows about, so it walks straight past the orphans. Hence the two steps below —
 * empty the journal, then unlink whatever is still sitting in the directory.
 *
 * This is deliberately blunt. It costs the whole cache, so it only fires once the directory has
 * drifted past [ceilingBytes] — well beyond the slack normal operation needs. It does not read the
 * journal, so it stays independent of Coil's on-disk format.
 *
 * Drift accrues only when a process dies with unlinks still queued, which is slow, so
 * [reconcileIfDue] rate-limits the check to [DEFAULT_INTERVAL_MS]. Even the healthy pass is a
 * `readdir` plus a `stat` per file — on a full 1 GB cache, tens of thousands of syscalls — and
 * `AppModules.initiate()` runs on every process start, including the WorkManager wake-ups that
 * cold-start the whole graph. Gating it on a marker file's mtime costs one `stat` on the starts
 * that skip.
