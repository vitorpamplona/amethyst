/**
 * Timer-free duration integrator: the elapsed time of the current state is
 * exact between transitions, so a segment is accounted only when the state
 * changes — plus on the accountant's pre-flush hook, so multi-hour stable
 * segments (a call, a backgrounded night with relays connected) still land in
 * the right day bucket without any periodic timer.
 *
 * Durations are measured with [SystemClock.elapsedRealtime] — the monotonic
 * clock — never the wall clock: an NTP/timezone correction mid-segment must
 * not fabricate or delete accounted time. (Wall time is only ever used for
 * choosing the epoch-day bucket, which happens in the accountant.)
 *
 * A `null` state means "nothing to account" (idle); subclasses decide what a
 * non-null state costs per elapsed millisecond.
