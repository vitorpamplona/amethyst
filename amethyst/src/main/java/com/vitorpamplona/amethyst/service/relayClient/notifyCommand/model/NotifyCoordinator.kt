/**
 * Routes relay `NOTIFY` payment prompts to the account they actually concern.
 *
 * A relay's NOTIFY does not reliably name a pubkey, so we can't parse the account out of the
 * message. Instead we correlate it with the AUTH that triggered it: a paid relay answers an
 * unauthorized AUTH with `OK <authEventId> false …` immediately followed by the NOTIFY. We *signed*
 * that auth event, so [AuthCmd.event] tells us which account's key it was. We remember that per auth
 * event, resolve the failing `OK` back to the signer, and drop the NOTIFY into THAT account's own
 * [NotifyRequestsCache] ([Account.relayNotifications]).
 *
 * The cache is per account (not a process-wide singleton), so a prompt for account A can never
 * surface under account B — and an unattributable NOTIFY is dropped rather than shown to the wrong
 * account. This is the fix for the stale-global-cache leak where switching accounts re-surfaced
 * another account's inbox.nostr.wine prompt.
