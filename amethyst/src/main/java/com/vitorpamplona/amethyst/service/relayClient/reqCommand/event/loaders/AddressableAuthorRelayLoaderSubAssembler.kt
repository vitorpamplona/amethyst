/**
 * Bridges missing-addressable-note authors into [UserFinderFilterAssembler].
 *
 * When an [AddressableNote] stub (event == null) references an author whose NIP-65 relay list
 * has not been loaded yet, [potentialRelaysToFindAddress] returns an empty set and the event
 * is never fetched. This manager detects those cases and injects a [UserFinderQueryState] for
 * the author into the existing [UserFinderFilterAssembler], which already knows how to fetch
 * kind-0 / kind-10002 and resolve outbox relays via [UserOutboxFinderSubAssembler]. Once the
 * relay list arrives, [EventFinderFilterAssembler] is invalidated and can query the correct relay.
