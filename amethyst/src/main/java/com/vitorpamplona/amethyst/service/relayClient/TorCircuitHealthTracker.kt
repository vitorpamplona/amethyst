/**
 * Detects the "Tor is Active but every circuit is dead" state and asks [onCircuitsDead] to
 * self-heal it.
 *
 * Tor can reach [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.tor.TorServiceStatus.Active] — SOCKS proxy up,
 * bootstrap "succeeded" off cached consensus — while no exit circuit actually works (the
 * `ExitTimeout` / `RESOLVEFAILED` barrage). The lifecycle watchdogs in
 * [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.tor.TorManager] can't see this: they only arm while status is
 * `Connecting`. The relay layer is the only place that has both halves of the signal — per-relay
 * success ([RelayConnectionListener.onConnected]) and failure
 * ([RelayConnectionListener.onCannotConnect]) — plus knowledge of which relays are Tor-routed.
 *
 * The discriminator (the whole point) is a *sustained* failure streak: fire only when, while Tor
 * is Active and connectivity is up, there is an unbroken run of Tor-routed failures that (a) holds
 * at least [FAIL_THRESHOLD] failures and (b) has lasted at least [SUSTAINED_MS], with **zero**
 * Tor-routed successes interrupting it. Any Tor success ends the streak — one good open means
 * circuits work, so suppress.
 *
 * The [SUSTAINED_MS] floor is essential, not cosmetic: the instant Tor flips Active the pool dials
 * the whole Tor-routed relay set at once, and on freshly built circuits a burst of ≥8 can fail
 * *before* the first Tor relay completes its handshake. Counting failures in a short window would
 * fire ~2s into a perfectly healthy warmup and wipe the good client (observed on device). Requiring
 * the streak to span [SUSTAINED_MS] gives a natural post-Active warmup grace — a real success
 * during warmup clears the streak; only genuinely dead circuits keep failing for the full span.
 * A gap longer than [SUSTAINED_MS] between failures also restarts the streak, so sparse unrelated
 * failures never accumulate.
 *
 * Gating on connectivity avoids resetting Tor during a general network outage (where clearnet
 * relays fail too). Arti emits no per-stream success log, so this success signal can only come from
 * the relay layer — a failure-only signal can't tell "all dead" from "some dead", and would reset
 * Tor every time a few dead relays are dialed.
 *
 * Register with [register] and tear down with [unregister]. All callbacks arrive on relay/OkHttp
 * threads, so the streak state is guarded by an intrinsic lock.
