/**
 * Per-account persistence for the set of joined `block/buzz` workspaces ([BuzzWorkspaces]), so the
 * app knows which relays to connect + NIP-42-authenticate + run member-channel discovery against on
 * a cold start — Buzz membership is server-side (granted by the HTTP invite claim), with no
 * NIP-51/kind-10009 join event to rebuild the set from.
 *
 * **Per account, not per device.** The set used to be one device-global key shared by every logged-in
 * account, on the reasoning that restoring only marks relays to sync and the relay gates each
 * read/write by the authenticated key anyway. That missed one consumer: the joined set also makes a
 * relay first-party in `AuthCoordinator.isFirstParty`, so one account joining a workspace silently
 * gave *every* other logged-in account an automatic NIP-42 login there — the bystander-account leak
 * the per-account gate exists to prevent. The key is namespaced by pubkey for the same reason the
 * relay-auth overrides moved to a per-account file.
 *
 * Still on the app-wide [sharedPreferencesDataStore] file — the namespacing, not the file, is what
 * separates accounts, and one file avoids a second DataStore per logged-in account.
 *
 * On construction it loads this account's saved relay URLs into [workspaces] (re-normalizing each,
 * dropping any that no longer parse), then mirrors every later change back to disk. Construct once
 * per account, eagerly.
