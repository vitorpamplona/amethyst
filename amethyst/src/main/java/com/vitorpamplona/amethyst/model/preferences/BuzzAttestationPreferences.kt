/**
 * Per-account persistence for the NIP-OA attestation this account holds
 * ([BuzzHeldAttestations]), so a held credential survives an app restart instead of needing to be
 * re-pasted. The key is namespaced by pubkey; the store used to be one device-global list because
 * each entry carried the agent key it authorized, which made the file a per-account store with
 * extra steps.
 *
 * On construction it loads this account's saved attestation and mirrors every later change back to
 * disk. Re-verification on restore is no longer done here: [BuzzHeldAttestations.put] verifies
 * against the agent key itself and rejects what fails, so a tampered on-disk credential is dropped
 * by the same gate that rejects a mistyped one. Construct once per account, eagerly.
