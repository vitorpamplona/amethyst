/**
 * How an undecided backup conflict is written to storage.
 *
 * A conflict is a question put to the user, and the backup it holds back stays held back until
 * they answer. That outlives the process it was raised in, so the three events it is made of —
 * the saved version, the incoming one, and the change that caused it — are stored and read back.
 *
 * The diff is **not** stored. It is recomputed from the two versions on load, so a conflict whose
 * incoming version no longer removes anything (the other app put it back) simply stops being one
 * instead of being resurrected from a stale description of itself.
 *
 * Kept out of `LocalPreferences` so it is reachable from a plain JVM test.
