/**
 * Pushes the relay classifications [TorRelayState] needs — which relays are DM, trusted, guessed, or
 * money-operation relays — as a union across every logged-in account.
 *
 * All four are the same fold: pick one set per account, union them, publish. It used to be written
 * out four times at ~30 lines each, and the copies had already drifted apart in trivial ways (an
 * `if (isEmpty)` guard that could never fire, differently-named accumulators). Sharing one
 * implementation is what keeps a fifth classification from being another 30 lines of the same
 * thing — and, more importantly, from being 30 lines that quietly forget a step.
