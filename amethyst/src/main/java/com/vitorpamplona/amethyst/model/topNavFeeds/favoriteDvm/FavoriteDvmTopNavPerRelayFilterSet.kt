 * Two relay sets, two distinct subscriptions:
 *
 * - [contentFetches] — for each user-configured content relay, the ids/addresses
 *   we want to pull (the actual notes the DVM curated).
 * - [listenRelays] — the union of DVM publish relays across all active DVMs
 *   (where they will deliver future kind 6300 / 7000 events for their requests).
 * - [requestIds] — the set of currently-active kind-5300 request ids to listen
 *   for. A single-DVM filter carries one; the merged "All favorite DVMs"
 *   filter carries one per favorite DVM.
