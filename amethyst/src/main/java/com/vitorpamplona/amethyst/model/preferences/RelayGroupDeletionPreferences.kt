/**
 * Device-global persistence for the set of deleted NIP-29 relay-group channels ([RelayGroupDeletions]),
 * so a channel the user deleted (kind-9008) stays gone across a restart — even if the host relay keeps
 * re-announcing a stale kind-44100 for it. Mirrors [BuzzChannelStarPreferences]: app-wide (not
 * per-account), loads the saved keys into the singleton on construction, then writes every later change
 * back. Construct once, eagerly.
