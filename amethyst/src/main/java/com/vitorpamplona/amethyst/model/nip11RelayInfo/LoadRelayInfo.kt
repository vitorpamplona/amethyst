/**
 * Eagerly warms the NIP-11 cache for a whole set of [relays] **in parallel** (each fetch on its own
 * coroutine), so callers that later read the cache — e.g. the NIP-29 relay-signed group check — get
 * hits instead of cold fetches. Warming a set serially would sum every relay's latency and let one
 * slow/unreachable relay stall the rest until its socket timeout; fanning out bounds the wait to the
 * slowest single fetch. [onEachLoaded] fires (on an IO thread) as each relay resolves, so a screen
 * can re-evaluate incrementally as docs arrive. The cache dedups, so re-warming is cheap.
