/**
 * Android implementation of [MarmotPushStateStore] — one JSON file per group
 * under `<rootDir>/marmot_push/<group id>.json`.
 *
 * Durability is the whole point of this class. A push tombstone is the only
 * lasting record that a token was revoked: any current member can re-emit a
 * revoked-but-still-signed record in a fresh kind `448` at any later epoch, and
 * a client that forgot the tombstone would accept it and start waking a device
 * its owner asked to be forgotten. So this survives restarts, and it is not
 * bounded by any wall clock, `owner_ts` or epoch count — a key is cleared only
 * by a strictly newer registration, or by its leaf leaving the group.
 *
 * Not encrypted, deliberately: the file holds tokens already encrypted to a
 * notification server this device cannot read, plus public routing. A failure
 * to decrypt would cost a tombstone, which is worse than the file being
 * readable by a process that has already broken out of the app sandbox.
