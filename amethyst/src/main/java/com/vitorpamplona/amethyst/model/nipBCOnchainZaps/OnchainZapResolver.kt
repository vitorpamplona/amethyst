 *
 * - Launching a verifier coroutine when a new event arrives (with per-event

 * - Re-running verification for visible notes when the chain tip advances or

 * - Owning the shared chain-tip poller flow that UI subscribes to.

 * Stateless from the caller's perspective — the per-event resolution state lives
 * on the source [Note] itself (`onchainZapResolved`), so it travels with the Note
 * across cache eviction and doesn't accumulate here.
