/**
 * The relays the app is **guessing** on the user's behalf because it has not seen their lists yet.
 *
 * Non-empty only while the corresponding event is absent — never because a list is empty, which is
 * a choice we honor (see `relayListOrDefaultsWhenUnknown`). It therefore empties itself, per list,
 * the moment the user's own data lands; no window, no timeout, no bookkeeping.
 *
 * **Deliberately NOT merged into [TrustedRelayListsState].** That one feeds `Account.isInMyRelayList`
 * -> `RelayAuthPermissionLedger` -> `RelayAuthResolver`, i.e. the NIP-42 AUTH decision. Guessed
 * relays must never make the app sign an AUTH challenge as though they were the user's own — that
 * would turn a timing signal into a signed identity assertion. The single consumer of this flow is
 * Tor routing.
