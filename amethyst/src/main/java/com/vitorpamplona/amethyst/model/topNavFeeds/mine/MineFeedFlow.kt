/**
 * Resolves the "Mine" top-nav selection to an author filter scoped to the logged-in user's own
 * pubkey, pinned to the user's own relays — their outbox, private-storage, local and proxy relays
 * (see [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.nip01UserMetadata.AccountMineRelayState]). Unlike the
 * follow filters, "Mine" doesn't need per-author outbox resolution from cache: the only author is
 * the user, and the user's relays are already known from their own account state — so we pin the
 * fixed set directly via [AuthorsByProxyTopNavFilter] (it associates each given relay with the
 * authors, which is exactly "query my relays for my events").
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for "Mine". Both the relay sub-assemblers (through each
 * screen's `liveXFollowListsPerRelay`) and the local DAL filters (through `liveXFollowLists`)
 * consume the produced [AuthorsByProxyTopNavFilter], so screens no longer need a dedicated
 * `TopFilter.Mine` branch: the generic author path already narrows to the user. It also makes
 * relay-set changes re-invalidate automatically — `liveXFollowListsPerRelay` re-emits whenever
 * [mineRelays] changes, through the sub-assemblers' existing `followsPerRelayFlow` collector.
