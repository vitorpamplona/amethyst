/**
 * Device-global persistence for the drawer section headings the user has collapsed, so the side menu
 * comes back folded the way they left it instead of springing fully open on every launch. Which
 * headings are folded is a per-device view choice, so unlike the hidden rows beside it in the drawer
 * it is never published to relays.
 *
 * Mirrors [RelayGroupDeletionPreferences]: app-wide (not per-account), loads the saved names on
 * construction, then writes every later change back. Takes the [DataStore] rather than a `Context`
 * so the whole cycle is exercised by a plain unit test against a temp file.
 *
 * Construct once, eagerly. The restore is a fire-and-forget coroutine, not a barrier, so the flow
 * reads as "nothing collapsed" until it lands; building this at app startup rather than on first use
 * puts that read many frames ahead of the drawer's first composition (and the store's file has
 * already been parsed by then, for `UiSharedPreferences`). Worst case if it ever lost that race is
 * cosmetic — a heading renders open and then folds — which is why no one waits on it.
