/**
 * Per-account persistence for the set of starred Buzz workspace channels ([BuzzChannelStars]), so
 * favorites survive a restart. Mirrors [BuzzWorkspacePreferences] in both shape and reasoning: the
 * key is namespaced by pubkey because a star is personal — it says which channels *this* user wants
 * pinned — and one device-global set meant one account's favorites reordered and badged every other
 * logged-in account's channel list. Loads this account's saved ids into [stars] on construction,
 * then writes every later change back. Construct once per account, eagerly.
