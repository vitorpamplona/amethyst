 * another account and back builds a fresh one, and `consumeRegularEvent` never re-notifies a duplicate,
 * so it would have stayed empty for the rest of the session.

 * event onto its addressable note and wakes the cache observers *first*, and only then copies it into
 * the channel — so a projection woken by that very emission reads a channel that is still empty, gets
 * [ChannelClassification.UNKNOWN], and, because nothing emits a second time, stays wrong until an
 * unrelated membership notice happens to arrive. (It also covers the case where the channel is never
 * populated at all: `consume` only touches it when the event carried relay provenance.) Reading the
 * event that caused the emission cannot race with itself.
 *
 * Keyed by group id alone, without the host relay: this is a fallback for [classifyBuzzChannel], which
 * still prefers the relay-scoped channel whenever that one has already been filled in.
