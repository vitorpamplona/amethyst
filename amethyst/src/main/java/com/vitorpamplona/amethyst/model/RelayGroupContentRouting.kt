/**
 * Resolves the **serving-relay hazard**. A group-scoped content event (kind-9 chat, poll, kind-11 thread…)
 * is keyed to its group channel by the relay that served it, because a NIP-29 event doesn't carry its host
 * relay. That is correct for the group's own host-pinned subscriptions, but a message resolved from a
 * **non-host** relay — e.g. a quoted kind-9 fetched by id during missing-event resolution — would be filed
 * under a channel keyed to that stranger relay, one the group's own screens never read, so the message
 * silently vanishes.
 *
 * Called only when there is **no** channel keyed to the serving relay for this group id (the fast, common
 * path attaches directly and never gets here). It picks the group's single confirmed **host** channel — one
 * that has received relay-signed state — to attach the stray to instead. Returns that host key, or null when
 * there is no single confirmed host (a genuinely new group on the serving relay, or an id ambiguous across
 * several hosts), in which case the caller keeps the serving-relay key as today's best effort.
 *
 * A phantom channel (one minted from an earlier stray) never has relay-signed state, so it can never be
 * chosen here — the redirect only ever lands on a real host, never on another phantom. This makes the fix
 * strictly safe: it can redirect a stray to a known host, but never divert a message away from one.
