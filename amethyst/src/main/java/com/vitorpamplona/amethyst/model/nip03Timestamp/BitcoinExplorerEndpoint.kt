 * the same Esplora API:
 * - OpenTimestamps verification ([TorAwareOkHttpOtsResolverBuilder]).
 * - NIP-BC onchain zaps (the `EsploraBackend` wired in `AppModules`).
 *
 * So a user who configures a custom explorer in the OTS settings gets it for
 * onchain zaps too, and both honour the same Tor preference: a configured
 * [OtsSettings] custom URL always wins; otherwise mempool.space is used when
 * Tor is active (it is reachable over Tor) and blockstream.info when it is not.
