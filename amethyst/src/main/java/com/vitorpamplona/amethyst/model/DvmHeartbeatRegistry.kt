/**
 * Strong, process-wide record of the latest heartbeat per DVM announcement address
 * (`Address(11998, dvmPubKey, dTag) -> createdAt`).
 *
 * Beat Notes themselves live in `LocalCache.addressables`, a WeakReference store with no strong
 * holder on the Discover screen — every GC sweep cleared them all at once and the freshness gate
 * collapsed for every DVM simultaneously (the list emptied and rebuilt one beat at a time). This
 * registry is the freshness source the gate and the liveness composables read: strong references,
 * fed by every beat-arrival path (global REQ, outbox batches, per-surface fetches — all beat
 * consumption routes through [record]).
 *
 * One entry per DVM address ever seen; timestamps only, so it stays tiny. `0` means "no beat".
