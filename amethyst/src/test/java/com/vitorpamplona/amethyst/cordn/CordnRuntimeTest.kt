/**

 * purge, restore, the invitation fan-out. Every one of those was a sentence in
 * a commit message and none of them was a test, which is the combination that
 * makes a rule quietly stop being true.
 *
 * Two seams make this possible without a device or a relay. `cipher` was
 * always one, because the Android KeyStore cannot run in a JVM unit test.
 * `links` is the second: production opens a real ContextVM transport per
 * coordinator, so without it nothing in this class could be reached at all.
 * Both default to the real thing.
