/**
 * The screen half of the Marmot/cordn boundary.
 *
 * `CordnIndependenceTest` in `commons` guards the models and the protocol
 * code; this guards the Android screens, which is where the coupling would
 * actually be convenient. A cordn chat screen that imported a Marmot composable
 * would work — and would then make Marmot's UI, which is frozen, unable to
 * change without breaking cordn.
 *
 * What cordn may share is what any feature shares: the design system, the
 * theme, navigation, and generic components. The line is drawn at
 * `marmotGroup`-named code, because that is where a real coupling would land.
 *
 * Third of the three guards §3.1 of `amethyst/plans/2026-09-19-cordn-ui.md`
 * asks for, added with the first screen rather than after the fifth.
