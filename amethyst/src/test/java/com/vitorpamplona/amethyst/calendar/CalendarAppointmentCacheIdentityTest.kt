/**
 * A 31923 appointment lands in `LocalCache` as TWO objects: the canonical `AddressableNote` under
 * its address, and a version note under the event id. Only the first is handed to feeds when the
 * event arrives, and only the first survives the cache sweep that runs on every app switch — so a
 * feed must query the addressables, which is what [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.screen.loggedIn.calendars.dal.CalendarAppointmentsFeedFilter]
 * now does. Scanning `LocalCache.notes` instead gave the calendar views a second identity for the
 * same appointment and made them flicker events in and out around every trip to the background.
 *
 * `LocalCache` is a process-wide object and JUnit's method order is hash-based, so every method
 * here uses its own author key and asserts only over that key's address range.
