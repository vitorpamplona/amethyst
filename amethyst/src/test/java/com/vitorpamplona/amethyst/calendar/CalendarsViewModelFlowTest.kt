/**
 * The model's cache-backed flows: the calendar picker's list, and the membership filter whose
 * "not loaded yet" answer used to be an empty set — which reads as "match nothing" and blanked
 * every lens until the kind-31924 arrived.
 *
 * Real dispatchers throughout, no virtual time. The flows seed on [Dispatchers.Default] (the scan
 * walks the whole cache and must stay off the UI thread), so their emissions land on real threads;
 * a test-scheduler Main would sit there un-driven while the test blocked waiting for them, and
 * every await would expire on the virtual clock first. Nothing here is driven by delays, so
 * virtual time buys nothing.
 *
 * Main is [Dispatchers.Unconfined] rather than [Dispatchers.Default] so that cancelling the
 * model's scope finishes synchronously on the cancelling thread. Cancellation is otherwise
 * asynchronous, and a continuation that resumed after `resetMain()` threw "Main dispatcher had
 * failed to initialize" onto a background thread — which `runTest` then reported against whatever
 * unrelated test started next.
 *
 * `LocalCache` is a process-wide object and JUnit's method order is hash-based, so every method
 * uses its own author key and asserts only over that key's events.
