/**
 * Pins the Onion-Location interceptor behavior the entire app's onion-routing
 * story relies on.
 *
 * Onion-Location is a free passive discovery mechanism: an `.onion`-equipped server
 * advertises its onion address via an HTTP response header, and the app caches the
 * mapping for later Tor-routed connections. The mechanism only works if **every**
 * OkHttp client built by the app installs the interceptors:
 *
 * - [OnionLocationInterceptor] on every client (no-proxy AND Tor-proxied) so we capture
 *   the header from whichever client happened to make the request.
 * - [OnionUrlRewriteInterceptor] on Tor-proxied clients only (clearnet clients must never
 *   try to resolve `.onion`).
 *
 * Wiring is enforced by [OkHttpClientFactory] and [OkHttpClientFactoryForRelays] taking
 * the cache as a **non-nullable** constructor parameter and unconditionally adding the
 * interceptors in their builder chain. Factory-instantiation in unit tests is blocked by
 * OkHttp 5's Android platform shim (it calls `android.util.Log.isLoggable`, which only
 * exists on a real device), so the wiring is pinned at the type level rather than via
 * reflective inspection of a built client. This suite covers the interceptors themselves
 * and the cache they share so any regression in their behavior — missing put, wrong
 * rewrite scheme, stale TTL, etc. — fails fast.
 *
 * The chain is a [Proxy] that only implements [Interceptor.Chain.request] and
 * [Interceptor.Chain.proceed]; same pattern as [LocalBlossomCacheRedirectInterceptorTest].
