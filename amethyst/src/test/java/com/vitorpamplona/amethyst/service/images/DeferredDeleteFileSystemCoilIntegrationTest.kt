/**
 * Integration test against the real Coil 3 [DiskCache], pinned to whatever
 * Coil version the app actually ships.
 *
 * Verifies the assumption [DeferredDeleteFileSystem] is built on: that Coil's
 * eviction (`trimToSize` → `removeEntry`) routes its unlink through
 * `fileSystem.delete()`. The pure unit tests prove the wrapper's behaviour;
 * this proves Coil drives it. If a future Coil version stops deleting via the
 * injected `FileSystem`, [coilEviction_routesEvictionThroughDeferredDelete]
 * fails and the wrapper has silently become a no-op.
