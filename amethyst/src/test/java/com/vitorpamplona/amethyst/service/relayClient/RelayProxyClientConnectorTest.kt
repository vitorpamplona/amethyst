/**
 * Guards the decision table in [RelayProxyClientConnector.apply]: which environment changes
 * are allowed to forgive a relay's accumulated reconnect backoff.
 *
 * Before this was keyed on network identity, the only signal was OkHttpClient reference
 * identity, which is rebuilt off the metered bit. That misses every transition where
 * metered-ness does not flip — wifi A -> wifi B, a VPN coming up, a captive portal clearing,
 * metered wifi -> cellular — leaving relays parked on a backoff earned against a network the
 * device already left. It also missed a Tor policy flip while Tor was already up, where both
 * client references stay identical.
