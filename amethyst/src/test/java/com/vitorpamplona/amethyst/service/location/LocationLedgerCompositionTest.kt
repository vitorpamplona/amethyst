 * seam together, exercising [LocationState]'s **default** `locationSource`
 * rather than overriding it the way [LocationStateTest] and [LocationFlowTest]
 * do. Each of those files mocks the other layer out, so neither can catch a
 * regression in the composition itself — e.g. a refcount that gets pinned
 * open (or closed) because `onListening` fires in an order or multiplicity
 * the two independent [LocationState] flows didn't anticipate. That failure
 * mode is unrecoverable at runtime: a pinned-open refcount means
 * `location.ms` accrues in the resource-usage ledger forever, with nothing
 * actually listening.
 *
 * Same dispatcher note as [LocationStateTest]: `runTest {}`'s default
 * `StandardTestDispatcher` does not drive this `combine` + `transformLatest` +
 * `stateIn(WhileSubscribed)` + `backgroundScope.launch { collect }` chain to
 * completion via `advanceUntilIdle()` alone, so every test here runs on
 * `UnconfinedTestDispatcher`.
