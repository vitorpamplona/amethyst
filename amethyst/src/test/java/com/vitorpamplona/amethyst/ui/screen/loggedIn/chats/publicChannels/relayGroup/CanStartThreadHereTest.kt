/**
 * Which channels may *start* a thread. The Threads screen's compose FAB writes a Buzz kind-45001
 * forum post on a Buzz relay and a NIP-7D kind-11 everywhere else, so the gate has to key on the
 * channel's declared type — not just on whether the relay would accept the event, which it does.
 *
 * The forum case is here rather than on-device because no relay we can reach in a manual pass
 * currently exposes a `t=forum` channel, and the allow-path is the half that must not regress: a
 * gate that only ever denies is indistinguishable from deleting the feature.
