/**
 * Unit tests for the pure NIP-9B draft-validation helper exposed on
 * [CommentPostViewModel]'s companion. The ViewModel itself is too coupled to
 * Compose state, the relay subscription stack, and signers to construct in a
 * unit test, but the helper is the only place where draft size, kind, and
 * author flow into the validator — so testing it covers what matters.
