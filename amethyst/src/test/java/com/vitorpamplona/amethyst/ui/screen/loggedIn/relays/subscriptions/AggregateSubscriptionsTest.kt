/**
 * The unit invariant behind the Active Subscriptions screen: a purpose's filter count and the
 * screen's total must be the *same thing counted the same way*, because the card draws one as a
 * share of the other.
 *
 * It was broken by batching. A relay-group state filter carries every joined group on its host
 * relay, and a public-chat filter carries every followed chat — so summing the per-entity rows
 * counted one filter once per entity it named. Six chats over six relays reported 144 filters where
 * 24 were on the wire, and the resulting "8% of all" divided an inflated number by a real one.
