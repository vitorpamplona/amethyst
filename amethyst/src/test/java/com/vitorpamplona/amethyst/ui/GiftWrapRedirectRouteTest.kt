/**
 * Why a screen waiting on a gift wrap has to be woken a second time.
 *
 * `LocalCache.consumeRegularEvent` emits the wrap note the moment the wrap is cached — which
 * is before anything has decrypted it, so `innerEventId` is still null and the wrap can say
 * nothing about where it leads. Everything that links the chain afterwards is plain assignment
 * on the note, which emits nothing. So that first emission is the only one a
 * `Route.EventRedirect` parked on a wrap ever sees, and the case below is what it sees: no
 * route, nothing to navigate to, wait forever — while the message it wanted sits decrypted in
 * the cache a few milliseconds later. `DecryptAndIndexProcessor` re-emits the wrap and seal
 * notes once the chain is linked, which is what turns the second case into the live one.
