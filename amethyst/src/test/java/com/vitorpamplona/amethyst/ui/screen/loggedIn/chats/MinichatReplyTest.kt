/**
 * A kind-9 chat message is a thread reply only when its `e` tag carries a NIP-10 marker.
 *
 * Three conventions share kind 9 and must not be confused:
 * - **NIP-C7** spends `q` on the in-chat reply and never mentions `e` at all, which is what leaves a
 *   marked `e` free to mean "thread reply".
 * - **WhiteNoise / Marmot** thread chat with a **plain, unmarked** `e` — an *in-chat* reply that has to
 *   keep rendering as a quote bubble in the timeline.
 * - **Buzz** threads with `["e", id, "", "reply"]` (nested: `root` + `reply`), which belongs in the
 *   minichat and must be dropped from the channel timeline.
 *
 * Getting this wrong is what put a Buzz thread reply in the main channel as a quote instead of in the
 * thread on its parent.
