/**
 * Pins the full NIP-34 collaboration surface across the four notification-plumbing
 * lists that have to move together — miss any one and either the event is never
 * asked for, or it arrives but never renders:
 *
 * 1. [NotificationsPerKeyKinds2] — the inbox-relay `#p`=me subscription. If the
 *    kind isn't listed here, the event never reaches this device unless it
 *    happens to arrive through some other subscription (a repo thread view,
 *    home-feed spillover). This is what gives you a merge notification when
 *    you close the app and come back an hour later.
 * 2. [RepliesAndReactionsKinds2] — the `#e`=<targetId> engagement subscription
 *    that fires when a patch/PR/issue row is on screen. This is what makes
 *    [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.model.GitStatusIndex] actually see status
 *    events so the closed/merged pill can render on the repo page.
 * 3. [NotificationFeedFilter.NOTIFICATION_KINDS] — the in-app Notifications tab
 *    kind gate. Without this, the event arrives from (1), sits in LocalCache,
 *    and never renders a row.
 * 4. [NotificationDispatcher.NOTIFICATION_KINDS] — the push/tray observer's
 *    kind gate. Without this, the event arrives from (1), sits in LocalCache,
 *    and never fires a system notification.
 *
 * A regression on any of (1)–(4) silently drops one specific transition
 * (comment on your PR, PR merged, patch closed, …) and there is no other
 * place to catch it.
