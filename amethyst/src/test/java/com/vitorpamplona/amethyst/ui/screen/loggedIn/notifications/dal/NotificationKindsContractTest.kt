/**
 * Pins the relationship between the two independently-maintained kind lists:
 *
 * - `NotificationKinds.SUBSCRIPTION_KINDS` (commons) — what Desktop asks
 *   relays for and toasts on. May contain ENVELOPE kinds (gift wraps) whose
 *   created_at is randomized per NIP-59, because Desktop surfaces the wrap
 *   itself as a DM row.
 * - `NotificationFeedFilter.NOTIFICATION_KINDS` (Android) — what renders as
 *   a row on the Notifications tab. Envelopes must never appear here; the
 *   unwrapped inner event is the row.
 *
 * The lists were briefly coupled (NOTIFICATION_KINDS spread
 * SUBSCRIPTION_KINDS), which silently pulled the kind-1059 wrap into the
 * Android feed. They are now maintained separately; this test is the tripwire
 * that keeps them from drifting apart unintentionally in either direction.
