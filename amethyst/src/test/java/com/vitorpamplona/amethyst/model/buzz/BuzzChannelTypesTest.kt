/**
 * The channel-type map the invite projection classifies against.
 *
 * It exists because reading the type off the [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.model.nip29RelayGroups.RelayGroupChannel]
 * is only correct *after* `LocalCache.consume(GroupMetadataEvent)` has copied the event into it — and
 * consume wakes the cache observers one step earlier, so the recompute that the arriving directory
 * triggers reads an empty channel, answers UNKNOWN, and never runs again. Deriving the type from the
 * metadata event that caused the emission is what makes that answer stable.
