/**
 * The serving-relay hazard router: a stray group-scoped content event (no channel keyed to its serving
 * relay) must be redirected to the group's single confirmed **host** channel, never to another phantom, and
 * never when the host is ambiguous. Also pins that a phantom channel — one that only ever received content —
 * reports no relay-signed state, which is what keeps [redirectStrayRelayGroupContent] from ever picking one.
