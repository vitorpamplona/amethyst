/**
 * The feed's animated elements defer building their `Transition` until a value actually changes,
 * because first composition has nothing to animate and building one per card per scroll is pure
 * waste (measured: roughly half the composition cost of every reaction-row button).
 *
 * The whole point of deferring rather than removing is that the animation must still play. These
 * tests pin that: they drive the clock manually and assert that the **first** change — the one that
 * happens right after the transition is lazily created — still shows outgoing and incoming content
 * simultaneously, which only a running animation does. A regression that turned the deferral into a
 * plain snap would show exactly one of them and fail here.
