/**
 * Upstream regression test for androidx.compose.foundation:foundation-layout.
 *
 * A `WindowInsetsAnimation` that is prepared and started but never ended — which is what a
 * cancelled IME animation looks like — leaves `InsetsListener.runningAnimation` set forever.
 * `onApplyWindowInsets` then matches neither of its two branches, so `composeInsets.update()`
 * is never called again and `WindowInsets.ime` is dead for the life of the window.
 *
 * Introduced in 1.4.0 (absent in 1.3.0, where `onApplyWindowInsets` updated unconditionally
 * once `onStart` had cleared `prepared`). Still present in 1.12.0 and 1.13.0-alpha01. The
 * compensating self-heal (`view.post(this)` -> `run()`) is scoped to `SDK_INT == R`, so on
 * API 31+ nothing clears the flag; `WindowInsetsHolder.resetState()` only runs when the
 * holder's accessCount transitions 0 -> 1, which never happens in an app whose shell always
 * reads insets.
 *
 * Filed upstream as b/552500419.
 *
 * [aCancelledImeAnimationMustNotWedgeTheAnimatedInset] FAILS on every version from 1.4.0 on, so it
 * is [Ignore]d to keep CI green. It is not a test of Amethyst code — it is the upstream repro we
 * attached to the bug. **Re-run it by hand after every Compose upgrade**: when it passes, the
 * upstream fix has landed and [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.insets.SafeImeInsets] can be retired.
 *
 * [theAnimationTargetSurvivesTheWedge] documents the asymmetry that makes a workaround possible
 * and is expected to PASS — `updateImeAnimationTarget` is called outside the guard. It stays
 * enabled, because it guards the premise [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.ui.insets.SafeImeInsets]
 * depends on: if a future Compose release stopped keeping `imeAnimationTarget` current, our
 * fallback would silently start reading a dead value too.
