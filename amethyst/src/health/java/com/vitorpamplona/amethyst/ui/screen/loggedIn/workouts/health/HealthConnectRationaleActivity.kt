/**
 * The Health Connect permissions rationale — the screen Health Connect itself opens when the user
 * taps "privacy policy" / "read more" next to Amethyst, on both the pre-request dialog and the
 * later data-management screens.
 *
 * Declaring the intent filters is not optional: without a target for
 * `androidx.health.ACTION_SHOW_PERMISSIONS_RATIONALE` (Android 13 and lower) or
 * `ACTION_VIEW_PERMISSION_USAGE` + `CATEGORY_HEALTH_PERMISSIONS` (Android 14+) the permission
 * request fails silently and no dialog appears at all.
 *
 * Deliberately its own activity rather than a route inside MainActivity: Health Connect launches it
 * cold, from outside the app, with no account loaded and no guarantee the user is even logged in.
 * It shows static, read-only copy and touches nothing account-scoped.
