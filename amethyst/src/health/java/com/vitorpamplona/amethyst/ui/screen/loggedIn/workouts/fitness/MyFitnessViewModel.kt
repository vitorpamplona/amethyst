 *
 * The log is built from both sources Amethyst has — Health Connect, and the user's own published
 * kind 1301 events (see [TrainingLog]) — so the dashboard is useful before any health permission
 * is granted and stays useful if one is revoked. Health Connect adds device detail; it is not a
 * precondition.
 *
 * Nothing here publishes or touches the network. The dashboard is the user looking at their own
 * numbers; sharing one is a separate, deliberate action from the workout list.
