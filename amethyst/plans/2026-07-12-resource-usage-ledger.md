# Resource Usage Ledger — battery/data accounting, user-visible + NIP-17 reportable

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Goal:** Let users (and developers) see how much network, connection time, and
background activity the app consumes, per subsystem — and let a user send that
data to the developers over NIP-17, reusing the crash-report consent pattern.
When consumption crosses "something is wrong" thresholds, proactively ask the
user (rate-limited, opt-out-able) whether they'd like to send a report.

Background: the 2026-07-12 ping-interval study (see
`2026-07-12-relay-ping-interval-study.md`) showed the dominant energy proxy is
connection-time (relays server-ping every 30–70s while connected) and that
battery bugs are production-only phenomena — so the ledger ships in release,
collects passively, and never transmits anything without an explicit user
action.

## Survey (existing components reused)

- **Send path** — the crash-report pipeline: `DisplayCrashMessages` prefills
  the NIP-17 DM composer via `routeToMessage(user = <dev pubkey>, draftMessage,
  expiresDays = 30)`; the user taps Send; `Account.sendNip17PrivateMessage`
  gift-wraps to the recipient's kind-10050 DM relays. Reused as-is — the
  ledger only builds a different draft string.
- **Persistence idiom** — `ScheduledPostStore` (Jackson + Mutex + tmp-rename +
  version envelope + StateFlow). Cloned as `ResourceUsageStore`.
- **Relay traffic** — counted by a new `RelayConnectionListener`
  (same hook `RelayStats` uses), NOT by modifying quartz.
- **Connection time** — integrated from `INostrClient.connectedRelaysFlow()`
  (exact between emissions; no timers).
- **Network class** — `ConnectivityManager.isMobileOrFalse` StateFlow.
- **Foreground** — new tiny `ForegroundTracker` (ActivityLifecycleCallbacks →
  StateFlow<Boolean>), registered next to `AppForegroundRecycleHook`;
  `MainActivity.isResumed` is not observable and slightly stricter than
  process-foreground.
- **HTTP subsystems** — `RoleBasedHttpClientBuilder` already funnels every
  role (image/video/uploads/money/nip05/preview/push) through two shared
  clients; a cached per-role `newBuilder().addInterceptor(counting)` wrapper
  gives per-subsystem byte attribution without touching the shared clients.
- **UI idioms** — `NotificationSettingsScreen` structure (`Scaffold` +
  `TopBarWithBackButton` + `SettingsSection` cards), route in `Routes.kt`,
  `composableFromEnd` registration, catalog entry via
  `SettingsCatalogBuilder.symEntry` (icon: existing `MaterialSymbols.Bolt` —
  no font regen).
- **App-open dialog** — `DisplayCrashMessages` pattern, mounted in the same
  `AppNavigation` block.

## Design

### Counters
Flat `Map<String, Long>` per UTC epoch-day, retained ~30 days. Key grammar:
`<area>...<mobile|wifi>.<fg|bg>[.<rx|tx>]`, e.g.:

- `net.image.mobile.bg.rx` — bytes downloaded by the image subsystem on
  cellular while backgrounded (same for video/uploads/money/nip05/preview/push)
- `relay.msg.wifi.fg.rx|tx` — approx relay websocket payload bytes
- `relay.connms.mobile.bg` — relay-connection-milliseconds (Σ relays × time)
- `wakelock.notif.ms` / `wakelock.notif.count`
- `worker.scheduledPost.runs` / `worker.calendarReminder.runs` /
  `worker.notificationCatchUp.runs`
- `app.starts` — process starts (detects WorkManager cold-start churn)
- `relay.connects.<net>.<vis>` / `relay.connfails.<net>.<vis>` — completed
  (re)connections and failed dials; each connect paid a TCP+TLS handshake,
  so high daily counts are the reconnect-churn signature
- `cpu.ms` — whole-process CPU time deltas ([android.os.Process
  .getElapsedCpuTime] sampled at flush): the honest aggregate of parsing,
  crypto, coroutines, and UI without per-subsystem guesswork
- `app.fgms` — time with UI visible; display power is proportional to it and
  it's the denominator for every per-day comparison
- `crypto.verify.count` / `crypto.verify.us` — event signature verifications
  (LocalCache.justVerify hook), settling "does Schnorr verify cost matter"
  with data

Deliberately not tracked (v1): per-screen time (route names leak behavior
patterns into a report — needs its own privacy review), per-coroutine or
per-dispatcher CPU (needs a thread registry; `cpu.ms` answers whether CPU
matters at all first), signing (user-action-rate, negligible).

Flat keys keep the store schema-free: new counters need no migration.

### Components (`amethyst/.../service/resourceusage/`)
- `UsageKeys` — key constants/builders + dimension helpers.
- `ResourceUsageStore` — daily buckets on disk (`resource_usage.json`),
  `mergeInto(day, deltas)`, `allDays()`, prune, plus alert state
  (lastAlertAtSec, optOut).
- `ResourceUsageAccountant` — in-memory `ConcurrentHashMap<String, LongAdder>`
  hot path (`add()` is called per relay frame), debounced flush (30s) into the
  store, day-rollover handling, merged read API for UI/report.
- `ForegroundTracker` — startedActivities>0 as StateFlow.
- `RelayUsageListener` — `RelayConnectionListener` counting sent/received
  frame sizes with current network/visibility dims.
- `RelayConnectionTimeIntegrator` — combines connectedRelays × isMobile ×
  isForeground; closes an accounting segment on every change and on
  `closeOpenSegment()` (called from accountant flush and reads, so multi-hour
  stable background sessions still account without any timer).
- `UsageCountingInterceptor` + counting response body — per-role HTTP bytes;
  wrapped clients cached per (role, base client identity).
- `ResourceUsageReportAssembler` — Markdown: device/app header (crash-report
  style), human summary (today + 7 days), fenced per-day counter dump.
- `ResourceUsageAlerts` — pure threshold logic (see below) + rate limiting.
- `DisplayResourceUsageAlert` — consent dialog (view details / send / not
  now / don't ask again).
- UI: `ResourceUsageScreen` under `ui/screen/loggedIn/settings/`.

### Wiring (AppModules / Amethyst / hooks)
- store + accountant + integrator constructed in `AppModules`; listener added
  via `client.addConnectionListener`.
- `ForegroundTracker` registered in `Amethyst.onCreate` (main process only).
- `RoleBasedHttpClientBuilder` gains an optional usage meter.
- `EventNotificationConsumer.withWakeLock` gains an optional held-duration
  callback (threaded through `NotificationDispatcher`).
- Workers increment their run counters via `Amethyst.instance` (guarded).
- `AppModules.trim()` flushes the accountant (backgrounding = natural flush).

### Alert thresholds (v1, deliberately conservative — tune with real reports)
Evaluated on the last *complete* day, OR today once exceeded:
- background cellular traffic > 50 MB/day
- relay connection time > 12 relay-hours/day while backgrounded on cellular
- notification wakelock held > 30 min/day
- process starts > 75/day
Rate limit: at most one prompt per 7 days; "don't ask again" persisted.
Never auto-sends: every path goes through the DM composer where the user sees
exactly what will be sent and must tap Send.

### Privacy
Counters are sizes, durations, and counts — no URLs, no relay names, no event
content. The report includes device model fields identical to the crash
report. Everything stays on-device until the user explicitly sends the DM
(NIP-40 30-day expiration, same as crash reports).

### Explicitly out of scope (v1)
- Layer 1 (Perfetto/ODPM macrobenchmarks) and Layer 2 (`TrafficStats` socket
  tags) — add only if the ledger proves blind somewhere (e.g. WS bytes are
  payload-approximate; TrafficStats would give exact on-wire bytes).
- Per-relay attribution in the ledger (RelayStats screens already exist).
- Desktop: accountant/store are Android-module for now; extraction to commons
  is mechanical if desktop wants it.
