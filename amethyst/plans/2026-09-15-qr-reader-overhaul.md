# QR Reader Overhaul

**Status:** queued (design + task plan; nothing implemented yet)
**Goal:** make scanning a QR code in Amethyst fast and near-certain — codes that are small,
far, dim, glossy, tilted, inverted, on a screen, or already sitting in the gallery should all
resolve on the first try, and a code the app *can't* route should say so instead of silently
dropping the user back where they started.

**Scope:** the reader (`amethyst/ui/screen/loggedIn/qrcode/QrCodeScanner.kt` and the four
screens that call it), plus a short second section on the *display* side, because half of
"scan this npub" is how legibly we draw the code for the other phone.

---

## 1. What we have today

`SimpleQrCodeScanner` is 30 lines that hand the whole job to
[zxing-android-embedded](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded) 4.3.0 via
`ScanContract`, which launches its own `CaptureActivity`:

```kotlin
ScanOptions().apply {
    setDesiredBarcodeFormats(ScanOptions.QR_CODE)
    setPrompt(stringRes(id = Res.string.point_to_the_qr_code))
    setBeepEnabled(false)
    setOrientationLocked(false)
    addExtra(Intents.Scan.SCAN_TYPE, Intents.Scan.MIXED_SCAN)
}
```

Four call sites:

| Call site | Payload expected |
| --- | --- |
| `ShowQRScreen.kt:182` (`NIP19QrCodeScanner`) | any `nostr:` / NIP-19 entity → `Route` |
| `KeyTextField.kt:106` | `nsec` / `ncryptsec` / bunker login |
| `AddNwcWalletScreen.kt:207`, `AddClinkDebitWalletScreen.kt:172` | `nostr+walletconnect://` |
| `Nip46SignerScreen.kt:174` | `bunker://` |

`libs.zxing` (ZXing **core**) is used only for *encoding* (`QrCodeDrawer.kt`,
desktop `QrCodeCanvas.kt`). The decoder we actually run is the one bundled inside
zxing-android-embedded.

### 1.1 Why it is hard to scan — verified causes

Each of these was checked against the library's source (4.x `master`) or our own code, not
recalled:

1. **It is a Camera1 app.** `com.journeyapps.barcodescanner.camera.CameraManager` imports
   `android.hardware.Camera`. Everything downstream inherits Camera1's limits: legacy-HAL
   preview sizes, no per-frame 3A control, and no zoom API wired up at all.
2. **Autofocus is a 2-second timer, not continuous.** `CameraSettings` defaults to
   `focusMode = FocusMode.AUTO` (`continuousFocusEnabled = false`), and `AutoFocusManager`
   re-triggers `Camera.autoFocus()` on `AUTO_FOCUS_INTERVAL_MS = 2000L`. Between triggers the
   frame can stay out of focus for up to two seconds — this is the "hold it still… still…
   still…" feel, and it is fatal for close-up codes where the lens needs to rack to macro.
3. **`MIXED_SCAN` halves our decode rate.** We pass `Intents.Scan.MIXED_SCAN`, which selects
   `MixedDecoder`, whose `toBitmap()` flips a boolean and inverts *alternate frames*. So for a
   normal dark-on-light QR — i.e. essentially every code we meet — half of all frames are spent
   decoding an inverted image that can never match.
4. **No zoom, at all.** Not pinch, not a button, not automatic. A code on a laptop screen across
   a desk, or a small printed code on a sticker, simply never resolves enough modules.
5. **No discoverable torch.** The stock `CaptureActivity` layout has no torch button;
   `DecoratedBarcodeView` only maps it to the volume keys. In a bar or a meetup hallway — the
   exact place people swap npubs — there is no way to light the code.
6. **The decode is cropped.** `BarcodeView` sets `decoderThread.setCropRect(getPreviewFramingRect())`,
   and `CameraPreview` defaults to `marginFraction = 0.1d`, so anything outside the centred
   viewfinder box is discarded even though the user can see it in the preview.
7. **One decode attempt per frame, no retry ladder.** `DecoderThread.decode()` builds a single
   `HybridBinarizer` over the cropped luminance and calls the reader once. No `TRY_HARDER`, no
   rotation retry, no multi-scale, no denoise. ZXing-Java's detector needs three clean finder
   patterns; glare, a crease, or a ~15° tilt past its tolerance and the frame is simply lost.
8. **It leaves the app.** `ScanContract` starts a separate activity with its own theme — no
   Material3, no edge-to-edge, a visible cold-start hitch, and `setOrientationLocked(false)`
   means rotating the phone recreates that activity and restarts the camera mid-scan.
9. **Failure is silent and ambiguous.** `NIP19QrCodeScanner` maps both "user cancelled" and
   "decoded fine, but `uriToRoute` returned null" to `onScan(null)`, and `ShowQRBody` reacts by
   flipping `presenting = true`. The user sees the QR screen again with no message. A decoded
   but unroutable payload (a bare hex pubkey, an `nsec1…`, a plain `https://` link, another
   app's code) is indistinguishable from "the camera never read it" — which is very likely part
   of why the reader *feels* broken even in cases where the decode succeeded. This is the same
   complaint as [#417](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst/issues/417), which was closed
   in 2023 but is still the current behaviour.
10. **No way in except the live camera.** You cannot scan a QR you were *sent* — a screenshot, a
    photo in the gallery, an image in a DM — nor paste one from the clipboard. Today the only
    path is to get a second screen to display it and point the phone at it.

### 1.2 One happy accident

`amethyst/build.gradle.kts:622-626` already declares `camera-core`, `camera-camera2`,
`camera-lifecycle`, `camera-view` and `camera-extensions`, and **nothing in the repo imports
`androidx.camera`** (grep across `.kt`/`.xml` returns only a `PreviewView` line in the generated
baseline profile). CameraX is already paid for in APK size and in the licence audit; we just
haven't used it. This plan finally does.

---

## 2. Target architecture

Replace the external-activity scanner with an in-app Compose screen:

```
Route.QrScanner  ──►  QrScannerScreen (Compose, Material3, edge-to-edge)
                        ├─ CameraX Preview (PreviewView)  ─────┐
                        ├─ CameraX ImageAnalysis ──► BarcodeDecoder ──► ScanResult
                        ├─ ScannerOverlay (cutout, hit boxes, torch, zoom, gallery)
                        └─ ScanOutcomeSheet (routes, or explains why it can't)
                                                               │
 gallery / clipboard / shared image ──► BarcodeDecoder.decode(Bitmap) ┘
```

**`BarcodeDecoder`** is a small interface with two entry points —
`decode(ImageProxy): List<ScanResult>` and `decode(Bitmap, cropRect, rotation): List<ScanResult>`
— so the camera plumbing, the UI, and the tests are all independent of which engine sits behind
it.

### 2.1 Decoder choice: `io.github.zxing-cpp:android`

**Recommended: `io.github.zxing-cpp:android:3.1.1`, replacing `com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded`.**

Licence (per CLAUDE.md, verified against the published POM at
`repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/zxing-cpp/android/3.1.1/android-3.1.1.pom`):
**Apache License 2.0 → permissive → OK, proceed.** No GPL family, no linking-exception question.

Why it is the right engine here:

- Its `Options` are exactly the knobs our failure modes need — `tryHarder`, `tryRotate`,
  `tryInvert`, `tryDownscale`, `tryDenoise`, `binarizer`, `maxNumberOfSymbols`. In particular
  `tryInvert` does inverted detection **inside one call as a fallback pass**, which is what
  `MIXED_SCAN` was reaching for without throwing away half our frames.
- `read(image: ImageProxy)` reads the Y plane straight out of the CameraX buffer
  (`planes[0].buffer`, `rowStride`, `cropRect`, `rotationDegrees`) — no YUV→RGB copy, no
  `Bitmap` per frame.
- Every `Result` carries a `Position` (four corners + orientation), which we need for the
  tappable multi-code overlay and for the auto-zoom heuristic.
- `sequenceId` / `sequenceIndex` / `sequenceSize` give us Structured Append (multi-part QR) for
  free — the door to large payloads later.
- `minSdkVersion 21` (from the AAR manifest) against our `minSdk = 26`. Fine.

Cost: a prebuilt `.so` per ABI — `arm64-v8a` 1.75 MB, `armeabi-v7a` 1.23 MB, `x86` 1.85 MB,
`x86_64` 1.82 MB uncompressed. With `splits.abi` already enabled, an arm64 APK grows by roughly
0.8 MB compressed, partly offset by dropping zxing-android-embedded. We already ship prebuilt
JNI (`secp256k1-kmp-jni-android`), so F-Droid precedent exists — but **confirm with the F-Droid
packaging before landing**, since a new prebuilt binary is the kind of thing their build
metadata cares about.

**Why not ML Kit barcode scanning:** it is proprietary and GMS-shaped, so it could only ship in
the `play` flavor and `fdroid` would need a FOSS decoder anyway — meaning we'd build the
zxing-cpp path regardless and then maintain two. Because `BarcodeDecoder` is an interface, an
ML Kit implementation in `amethyst/src/play/` (the pattern `MLKitImageLabelService.kt` already
uses in both flavor trees) stays a cheap, later, measurement-driven option. Phase 0 exists to
decide whether it's ever needed.

**Fallback if the native lib is rejected:** keep `libs.zxing` (already present, ZXing-Java, zero
new bytes) behind the same interface. Phases 1, 3 and 4 below — the camera stack, the feedback
model, and image import — are decoder-independent and carry most of the win on their own.

---

## 3. Phases

### Phase 0 — Build the ruler before cutting (do this first)

Nothing here ships; it exists so every later claim is measured rather than asserted.

- [ ] Assemble a fixture corpus under `amethyst/src/androidTest/assets/qr/`: ~60 PNGs of real
      Amethyst payloads (`npub`, `nprofile` with relay hints, `nevent`, `naddr`,
      `nostr+walletconnect://`, `bunker://`, a Concord invite) rendered by our own
      `QrCodeDrawer` and then degraded — gaussian blur, 8/15/30° tilt, perspective, 30 %/10 %
      contrast, inverted, JPEG artefacts, partial glare, photographed-off-a-screen moiré, and
      a "small in frame" set at 120/80/48 px across.
- [ ] `QrDecodeCorpusTest` (androidTest): decode every fixture with (a) today's ZXing-Java +
      `HybridBinarizer` path and (b) zxing-cpp with the Phase 2 options. Report a pass rate per
      category and per-image median decode time.
- [ ] Record the baseline numbers in this file. **Gate:** if zxing-cpp does not clearly beat
      ZXing-Java on the degraded sets, drop §2.1 and keep ZXing-Java behind `BarcodeDecoder`.

### Phase 1 — In-app CameraX scanner (the structural fix)

- [ ] `BarcodeDecoder` interface + `ScanResult` (text, bytes, format, corner positions,
      sequence info) in `amethyst/.../ui/screen/loggedIn/qrcode/decode/`.
- [ ] `QrScannerScreen` — `PreviewView` + `ImageAnalysis` bound to `LocalLifecycleOwner` via
      `ProcessCameraProvider`, `STRATEGY_KEEP_ONLY_LATEST`, `OUTPUT_IMAGE_FORMAT_YUV_420_888`,
      analysis resolution requested at 1280×720 with a 1920×1080 fallback via
      `ResolutionSelector`. Analysis runs on a single background executor; results hop back to
      the main thread through a `StateFlow`.
- [ ] Register `Route.QrScanner` in `Routes.kt` / `AppNavigation.kt` and move the four call
      sites onto it. `SimpleQrCodeScanner` keeps its `(String?) -> Unit` signature as a thin
      wrapper so the wallet/bunker/login screens change by one import, not a rewrite.
- [ ] Camera permission with `accompanist-permissions` (already a dependency, used by
      `TakePicture.kt`): inline rationale, and an "Open settings" path when permanently denied —
      today a denied permission just bounces the user out of `CaptureActivity` with no
      explanation.
- [ ] Focus: rely on CameraX's continuous AF, plus tap-to-focus through
      `PreviewView.meteringPointFactory` → `FocusMeteringAction` with AF+AE, auto-cancel on.
      This alone removes cause §1.1.2.
- [ ] Remove `com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded` from `libs.versions.toml` and
      `amethyst/build.gradle.kts`. **Keep `libs.zxing`** — encoding still needs it.
- [ ] Delete the decorative crop: analyse the full frame (or a ≥90 % ROI), and let the
      viewfinder cutout be purely visual. Fixes §1.1.6.

### Phase 2 — Make each frame count

- [ ] Decoder options: `formats = {QR_CODE, MICRO_QR_CODE, RMQR_CODE}`, `tryInvert = true`,
      `tryRotate = true`, `tryDownscale = true`, `binarizer = LOCAL_AVERAGE`,
      `maxNumberOfSymbols = 5`. `tryHarder` on the still/import path always; on the live path
      alternate a cheap pass with a `tryHarder`/`tryDenoise` pass every Nth frame so the frame
      rate stays interactive.
- [ ] **Zoom.** Pinch-to-zoom (`CameraControl.setZoomRatio` driven by a
      `TransformableState`) plus a 1×/2× quick toggle. Then auto-zoom: after ~1.2 s with no
      decode, ramp the zoom 1.0 → 2.0 → back over a couple of seconds; if a code *is* decoded
      but its `Position` spans less than ~25 % of the frame's short side, zoom so it fills
      ~60 % and re-read. Fixes §1.1.4, the single biggest "it just won't read" cause.
- [ ] **Torch.** A visible toggle in the overlay, plus auto-suggest: the analysis frame's Y plane
      gives mean luminance for free — under a threshold for ~1 s, surface the torch button
      prominently (never auto-fire it; that's rude in a bar and worse in a meeting).
- [ ] Dedupe: ignore an identical payload re-decoded within 1.5 s so a held-steady code doesn't
      fire the handler repeatedly.
- [ ] Structured Append: accumulate parts keyed by `sequenceId`, show "2 of 3 captured", emit
      once complete, time out after 30 s. Groundwork for large/animated payloads.

### Phase 3 — Tell the user what happened

This is the cheapest phase and probably the largest perceived improvement.

- [ ] Split today's single `null` into an explicit outcome type: `Cancelled`,
      `PermissionDenied`, `Decoded(text) → Route`, and `Decoded(text) → unroutable`.
- [ ] On a decode: haptic tick (`HapticFeedbackType.LongPress`, matching `SwipeToDelete.kt` and
      the wallet wizard) plus a brief highlight drawn over the code's four corners.
- [ ] On **unroutable** content, show a bottom sheet with the decoded text, what we think it is,
      and actions — *Open link* for `http(s)`, *Copy*, *Search*, *Try again*. Closes the
      ambiguity behind §1.1.9 and [#417](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst/issues/417).
- [ ] When ≥2 codes are in frame, draw a tappable box over each and let the user pick, instead
      of silently taking whichever ZXing found first.
- [ ] Extract payload classification out of `MainActivity.uriToRoute` into a pure, JVM-testable
      `classifyScannedPayload(text): ScannedPayload` (nostr entity / wallet connect / bunker /
      nostrconnect / http(s) / lightning / unknown). `uriToRoute` keeps routing; the scanner
      gets a testable "what is this?" answer, and a bare 64-char hex pubkey — issue #417's
      original case — becomes trivial to accept.

### Phase 4 — Scan things that aren't in front of the camera

- [ ] **From the gallery:** a picker button in the overlay
      (`ActivityResultContracts.PickVisualMedia`) → decode the bitmap with the full
      `tryHarder + tryRotate + tryInvert + tryDenoise` option set, and on failure retry at
      2× and 0.5× scale before giving up.
- [ ] **From the clipboard:** if the clipboard holds an image, offer "Scan copied image"; if it
      holds text that `classifyScannedPayload` recognises, offer to use it directly. Covers the
      overwhelmingly common "someone sent me a screenshot of their npub" flow.
- [ ] **Shared in:** accept `ACTION_SEND` with an `image/*` MIME type into the scanner, so
      "Share → Amethyst" from a gallery or chat app resolves the code. (The manifest already has
      an `ACTION_SEND` image target for new posts — this needs to be a distinct, explicitly
      labelled entry, not a hijack of that one.)

### Phase 5 — The display side

Half of a scan is the code on the *other* screen.

- [ ] `ShowQRScreen` does **not** boost brightness, while `ShareNoteAsQrScreen.kt:238-249`
      already does. Extract that into a `KeepScreenBrightAndOn()` composable (brightness 1f +
      `FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON`, restoring the previous value on dispose) and use it on both. On a
      dim OLED in dark mode this is the difference between scannable and not.
- [ ] `QrCodeDrawer.kt` hardcodes `CornerRadius(20f)` for the finder patterns regardless of how
      many pixels a module is — at small draw sizes that rounds a meaningful fraction of the
      finder away. Scale the radius with module size (cap around 20 % of a module).
- [ ] Error correction is fixed at `ErrorCorrectionLevel.Q`. For long payloads (an `nprofile`
      with two relay hints, a Concord invite) Q pushes the version up, so modules get smaller —
      and small modules, not error correction, are what actually defeats a camera at arm's
      length. Measure Q vs M across our real payload lengths on the Phase 0 corpus and pick per
      length rather than globally.
- [ ] Verify the `.clip(QuoteBorder)` 15 dp rounding never eats into the 4-module quiet zone at
      the sizes we actually render.

---

## 4. Testing

| Level | What |
| --- | --- |
| JVM unit | `classifyScannedPayload` over every payload we claim to accept, plus junk, plus the bare-hex and `nsec` cases; Structured Append accumulator (ordering, duplicates, timeout). |
| androidTest | `QrDecodeCorpusTest` (Phase 0) as a permanent regression gate — pass rate per degradation category, asserted against the recorded baseline so a decoder or option change can't quietly regress. |
| androidTest | Bitmap-import path end to end: fixture → `decode(Bitmap)` → `ScannedPayload`. |
| Manual matrix | Printed sticker at 10/30/60 cm; phone screen at 30/60/100 cm; laptop screen across a desk; dark room with and without torch; behind glossy glass; 15°/30°/45° tilt; two codes in frame; inverted (light-on-dark) code. Record pass/fail before and after. |
| Macrobenchmark | Time from tapping "Scan QR" to first preview frame — the current external-activity cold start is part of what the change should erase. |

## 5. Risks

- **APK size** — ~0.8 MB compressed on arm64 for the native decoder, partly returned by
  dropping zxing-android-embedded. Phase 0's gate is what justifies it.
- **F-Droid** — a new prebuilt `.so` from Maven Central; check with the F-Droid packaging before
  landing rather than after. The ZXing-Java fallback keeps this from being a dead end.
- **Camera device variance** — CameraX is far more uniform than Camera1, but zoom ratio ranges
  and torch availability still vary; every control must degrade to hidden rather than broken.
- **Scope creep into the display side** — Phase 5 is deliberately last and independent.
- **Desktop** — `desktopApp` has no scanner today and this plan doesn't add one. If webcam
  scanning is ever wanted, `BarcodeDecoder` + the payload classifier are the reusable halves;
  the CameraX screen is not.

## 6. Out of scope

Animated / BC-UR multi-frame QR *generation*, NFC handoff, and any change to what the four
existing call sites do with a successful payload.
