/**
 * Partitions WebView storage (cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB, service workers) per Nostr account.
 *
 * Without this, every account on the device shares one cookie/storage jar, so a web app stays logged
 * in as account A after the user switches to account B — leaking A's session to B and letting a site
 * correlate a user's separate pseudonymous npubs.
 *
 * The name is an OPAQUE token minted by the trusted main process (a truncated SHA-256 of the account
 * pubkey — see `NappletWebViewProfiles` in `:amethyst`). This keyless `:napplet` process must never
 * learn which account it is running for, so it only ever sees the hash, validates its shape, and uses
 * it as a storage key. Same account always maps to the same name, which is what makes a switch away
 * and back restore the earlier session intact.
