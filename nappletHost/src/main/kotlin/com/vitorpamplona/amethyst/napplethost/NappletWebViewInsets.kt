/**
 * Stops an **embedded** sandbox WebView from inseting its own web content for the system bars.
 *
 * On targetSdk 35+ a WebView auto-applies any window insets it receives to its web content. The
 * full-screen [NappletHostActivity] handles this by consuming the insets at its root before they reach
 * the WebView; an embedded surface (browser / nsite / napplet hosted in a SurfaceControlViewHost) has
 * no such root, and is already placed inside the host's inset-free content area — so without this the
 * page gets padded a *second* time, leaving an empty band under the status and navigation bars.
 *
 * We zero only the system-bar + display-cutout insets and keep IME, so the page still resizes for the
 * soft keyboard. Setting the listener also bypasses the WebView's own auto-apply, which is the point.
