/**
 * A context that makes a hosted WebView (embedded surface OR full-screen activity) follow the **app** theme
 * ("DARK"/"LIGHT") rather than the device.
 *
 * WebView's dark decision (`prefers-color-scheme` via algorithmic darkening) reads the context's **theme**
 * (`?android:attr/isLightTheme`), NOT just the Configuration `uiMode` — and an off-window
 * `SurfaceControlViewHost` surface context carries neither the host window's theme nor its night mode. So we
 * force the night flag in the Configuration AND wrap it in a DayNight theme whose `isLightTheme` then resolves
 * from that flag.
 *
 * (Verified on device with a standalone repro: `createConfigurationContext` alone — a night Configuration with
 * no theme — does NOT flip the renderer; the DayNight `ContextThemeWrapper` is what does it, even across the
 * cross-process embedded surface. `setApplicationNightMode` and per-WebView config dispatch do nothing.)
 *
 * "SYSTEM" (or any unrecognized value) returns [base] unchanged, i.e. follows the device — the host already
 * resolves SYSTEM→DARK/LIGHT before handing the theme down for the embedded surfaces.
