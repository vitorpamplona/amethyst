/**
 * The picker behind an HTML `<input type="file">` in any of Amethyst's WebViews.
 *
 * A WebView shows no picker of its own: unless the app overrides
 * `WebChromeClient.onShowFileChooser`, tapping a file input is a silent no-op. Every host here does
 * override it, and they all build their request through this so the browser, the full-screen napplet /
 * nSite sandbox, and both embedded surfaces filter, multi-select and capture identically.
 *
 * A request is described by plain data (accept list, multi-select, capture, title) rather than by a
 * ready-made Intent, because the two embedded hosts have no Activity of their own and must ask the
 * main process to run the picker for them. Shipping data keeps the keyless `:napplet` process unable
 * to hand the trusted process an arbitrary Intent to start — it can only ask for a file picker.
