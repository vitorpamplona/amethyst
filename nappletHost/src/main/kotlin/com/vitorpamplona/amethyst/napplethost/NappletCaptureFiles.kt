/**
 * The scratch files a camera app writes a WebView capture into, and the [FileProvider] URIs that
 * expose them.
 *
 * `ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE` only returns a full-resolution photo when it is handed somewhere to put it
 * (`EXTRA_OUTPUT`); without one it returns a thumbnail in the result extras, which is useless as an
 * upload. So each capture option gets its own empty file here first.
 *
 * They live in `cacheDir`, which is one directory shared by the main and `:napplet` processes, so it
 * does not matter which side ran the picker. They cannot be deleted as soon as the capture returns —
 * the page may not read the file until the user submits the form, which can be minutes later — so
 * [sweepStale] reclaims them on a later run instead, and the OS can evict the whole directory under
 * storage pressure regardless.
