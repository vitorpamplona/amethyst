 * Every surface that can start an Activity uses this, so the full-screen browser, the full-screen

 * drift apart in how they filter, multi-select, or offer the camera.
 *
 * Must be constructed as a **field** of [activity]: it registers its activity-result contracts in the
 * constructor, and `registerForActivityResult` has to run before the activity reaches STARTED.
