/**
 * What a front end plugs into the shared rich-text viewer: the [RichTextSegmentRenderer] for its
 * platform leaves (zoomable media, LaTeX, payments, link previews, Blossom links) and its markdown
 * renderer. The shared viewer parses, lays out paragraphs and renders text, emoji, hashtags and
 * mentions itself, and asks this for everything else.
 *
 * A front end installs its own through [LocalRichTextPlatform] at its composition root (Android
 * does so in its theme). Without one, [Plain] renders every platform segment as text, which is
 * what previews and a front end still wiring its leaves get.
