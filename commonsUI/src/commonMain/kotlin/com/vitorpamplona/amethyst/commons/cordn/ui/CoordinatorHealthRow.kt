/**
 * Whether a coordinator is answering.
 *
 * Losing a coordinator is not like losing a relay: relays are redundant and the
 * next one has the same events, while a coordinator is the single authority for
 * the groups it carries. So "not responding" means those conversations have
 * stopped, not that they are slower — which is why it gets a row of its own
 * rather than a dot.
 *
 * Three states, not two. [CoordinatorHealth.State.isUnknown] (nothing tried
 * yet) reads as neutral, because showing a fresh session a red marker for a
 * coordinator that is probably fine trains people to ignore the marker that
 * matters.
