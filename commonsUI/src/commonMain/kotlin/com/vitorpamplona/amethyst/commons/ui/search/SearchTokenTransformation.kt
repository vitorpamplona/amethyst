/**
 * Draws the tokens the search language holds as chips, over the plain text that stays the field's
 * real value.
 *
 * The value is never rewritten — every rendering is a view of it — so undo, IME composition, text
 * selection and a paste all keep working on exactly what the reader typed, and copying the field
 * yields a query that can be pasted back.
 *
 * Mapping the caret, the selection and the IME's composing region across a chip that is shorter
 * or longer than its text is left to the text field: an [OutputTransformation]'s replacements are
 * mapped by the field itself, which keeps every one of those ranges inside the drawn text. (The
 * legacy `VisualTransformation` this replaced asked a hand-written offset mapping instead, and
 * Android's keyboard bridge crashed on it whenever the composing region sat inside a chip.)
 *
 * A token only settles into a chip once the caret has left it: [caret] is read on every run and
 * passed straight through to [SearchTokenizer.drawable], so a half-typed `#bit` stays plain text
 * under the cursor rather than reflowing on every keystroke. It is a snapshot read, so the field
 * redraws when it changes; return null for a field nobody is typing in.
 *
 * [displayName] is asked for a key token's owner and [groupName] for a group's id; returning null
 * leaves the token short-formed rather than named, which is what something that has not arrived
 * yet should look like — an invented name would be worse than a visible id.
