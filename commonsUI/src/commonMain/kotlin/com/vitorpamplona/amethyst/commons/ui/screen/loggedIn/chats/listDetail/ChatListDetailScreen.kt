/**
 * A chat list that opens its chats beside itself when there is room, like the Messages screen.
 *
 * On a Compact pane this is just [list] on [nav]: tapping a chat pushes it. Wider, [list] takes the
 * left pane and the chats it opens ([isDetailRoute]) render in the right one through
 * [ChatDetailPane], so the list stays put while the user hops between chats. The decision reads
 * the pane this screen occupies, not the window, for the same reason `MessagesScreen` does.
 *
 * [isDetailRoute] should be a top-level function reference: it is captured by the remembered nav.
