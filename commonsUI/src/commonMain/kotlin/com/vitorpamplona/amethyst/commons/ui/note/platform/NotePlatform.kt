/**
 * The platform halves of the shared note renderer: what a note card needs that only the front end
 * can draw or do. Media players and the zoomable viewer, maps and reverse geocoding, the note types
 * built on a platform engine (audio players, chess, the git browser, meeting rooms, napplets), the
 * reactions/zap row with its wallet hand-offs, and the post editor.
 *
 * The shared note code calls these through [LocalNotePlatform]; a front end installs its own at the
 * composition root (Android does in its theme). Every member defaults to drawing nothing, so a
 * preview, or a front end still wiring a piece, gets an empty slot rather than a crash.
