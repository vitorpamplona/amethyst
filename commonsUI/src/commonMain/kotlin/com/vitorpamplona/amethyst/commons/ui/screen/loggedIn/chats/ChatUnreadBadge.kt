 * The unread pill every chat list shares: Concord channels, Marmot groups.
 *
 * Sizing is `sizeIn` + padding rather than a fixed `size`, so "99+" widens the
 * pill instead of being clipped by it, and the label rides `labelSmall` rather
 * than a hardcoded sp so it still tracks the reader's font scale.
 *
 * [contentDescription] is the caller's, because the plural that reads well out
 * loud is per-surface ("3 unread messages" vs "3 unread invites"); the pill
 * itself is the same object everywhere.
