 * Makes everything inside read-only: taps, long-presses and keyboard activation never reach a
 * child, but drags pass through, so the content can sit inside a scrolling container. Used where
 * a note is shown for inspection only, e.g. a signer consent prompt, whose renderers would
 * otherwise vote, RSVP, accept badges or open quick actions on an event that does not exist yet.
 *
 * Presses and releases are consumed in the [PointerEventPass.Initial] pass, before any child sees
 * them, and tap/click detectors ignore a consumed press. Movement is left alone, so the parent's
 * scroll still claims the drag. Only the activation keys are swallowed: Tab still moves focus out.
