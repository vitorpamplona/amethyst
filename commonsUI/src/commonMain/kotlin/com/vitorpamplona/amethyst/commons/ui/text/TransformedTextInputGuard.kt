/**
 * Wraps a text field whose [androidx.compose.foundation.text.input.OutputTransformation] changes
 * the text's length (the `@npub1…` → `@Name` mention chips), so the soft keyboard cannot crash it.
 *
 * Compose maps every IME command in a batch through the offset mapping of the text as it was
 * *before* the batch. Its `setSelection` then sets the mapped offset without clamping it, so a
 * batch that first shortens the text (deleting or replacing a mention chip) and then moves the
 * cursor puts the cursor past the end of the text and throws
 * `IllegalArgumentException: Expected TextRange(68, 68) to be in TextRange(0, 18)`. Samsung
 * Keyboard sends exactly that batch. The bug is in foundation's `ImeEditCommand.setSelection`
 * (still present in 1.13.0-beta02).
 *
 * On Android this commits the commands queued so far before a `setSelection` that arrives inside a
 * batch, so the selection is mapped through the text it lands in. Other platforms don't batch IME
 * commands this way and render [content] as is.
 *
 * @param active false renders [content] as is: a field without an OutputTransformation has no
 *   offset mapping to go stale. Keep it constant for a field; flipping it recreates [content].
