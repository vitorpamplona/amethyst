 * The URLs written on the top-level lines of [markdown]: lines that are not inside a list, a
 * block quote, a code block, a table or an HTML block. Media at those URLs sits directly in the post's column, so it may
 * run edge to edge with the post's own media; anything nested keeps the indent it is drawn in.
 *
 * A line scan, not a parse: a list item or quote holds every line up to the next blank line
 * (CommonMark's lazy continuation), and an indented line after one stays inside it.
