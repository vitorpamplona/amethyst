 * A Simple Nostr Object the reader can turn, move and zoom.

 * Only turning needs a new raster — it changes which faces point at you.
 * Moving and scaling are a [graphicsLayer] transform of the frame already
 * drawn, which costs nothing per frame; when the gesture ends the object is
 * redrawn at the resolution the zoom now deserves, so it sharpens where it
 * settled rather than staying an upscaled bitmap.
 *
 * A solid object also offers a light switch, because turning something over to
 * understand its shape is the one case DECK-0003 §4 has in mind when it allows
 * a client to light an object: unlit, a cube of a single colour is a flat
 * hexagon however far you turn it. The feed keeps §4's unlit default, so an
 * object looks the same everywhere it is quoted, and the switch starts off.
 * See [SnoLighting] for what it does and what it costs.
 *
 * Unlike [SnoThumbnail] this does not go through Coil: a turn produces a new
 * angle every frame and each would become its own cache entry, evicting the
 * image cache within a second. Nothing here is worth caching — the object is
 * the event, and redrawing it is cheaper than remembering it.
