/**
 * What a decoded QR string *is*, independent of whether any particular screen can act on it.
 *
 * The scanner needs this separately from routing: `uriToRoute` answers "where does this
 * navigate", and collapses everything it doesn't recognise into `null` — which is how a
 * perfectly good scan of an unsupported payload became indistinguishable from the camera never
 * reading anything (issue #417). Classifying first lets the UI say *which* of those happened.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin on purpose: no Android, no `LocalCache`, no navigation. It is the one piece of the
 * scanner that can be exhaustively unit-tested on the JVM.
