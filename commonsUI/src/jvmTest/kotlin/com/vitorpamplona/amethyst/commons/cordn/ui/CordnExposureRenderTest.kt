/**
 * Renders the cordn disclosure surface headlessly and looks at the pixels.
 *
 * Compiling a composable proves almost nothing about it. Two failure modes it
 * cannot catch, and this can:
 *
 * - **A missing string resource throws at render, not at build.** The generated
 *   `Res.string.*` accessors compile whether or not `strings.xml` has the entry,
 *   so a typo ships and crashes the screen the first time someone opens it.
 *   This suite opens it.
 * - **A composable that draws nothing** — a zero-height container, a colour that
 *   equals its background — still builds and still "renders".
 *
 * It asserts structure rather than exact pixels, so it does not become a
 * screenshot test that has to be re-blessed on every font or Material bump. It
 * does not write files either; what it checks is what it can check honestly
 * without a human looking. `ImageComposeScene` rasterises in software, so this
 * needs no display and runs in CI.
