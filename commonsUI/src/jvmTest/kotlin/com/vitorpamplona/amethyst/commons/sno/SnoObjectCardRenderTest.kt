/**
 * The card actually draws, in real Compose.
 *
 * Everything under this — the parser, the rasterizer, the image bridge — has
 * its own tests, and all of them passed while two defects sat in the Compose
 * layer above: a detail line that clipped mid-word because its column had no
 * width to work with, and a viewer that rasterised on the composition thread.
 * Compiling proved nothing about either. This renders the card offscreen
 * through `ImageComposeScene` (no display, no device) and asserts the object
 * reached the screen through Coil, the fetcher and the platform image bridge.
