/**
 * Every class Quartz's `EventFactory` can build gets a card of its own in the feed.
 *
 * A kind with no branch in `RenderNoteRow` silently falls through to `RenderTextEvent`, which
 * draws the event's `content` as a note: a blank card for tag-only kinds, raw JSON or ciphertext
 * for others. Nothing else notices, so this test reads both sources and checks that each class
 * the factory constructs is matched by an `is` branch of `RenderNoteRow` or `AcceptableNote`,
 * directly or through a supertype (resolved by reflection, so a base-class branch like
 * `is DvmRequestEvent` covers its subclasses).
 *
 * Adding a kind to Quartz therefore needs a card here, or an entry in [TEXT_CARD_KINDS] saying
 * why the text card is the right one.
