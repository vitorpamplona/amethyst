# Plan: investigate moq-relay 0.10.x per-broadcast subscribe-routing race

**Status:** ✅ CLOSED. The flake was a `:quic` packet-acceptance bug,
not a moq-relay routing race. Merging
`origin/main` (5 commits: ALPN-list threading `2a4c07ae`, PTO STREAM
retransmits `d5c854be`, 1-RTT key update `b622d0c9`,
multiconnect/multiplex `86a4727e`, qlog flush `31d19258`) closes
it. Post-merge sweep:
**5/5 BUILD SUCCESSFUL, 55/55 tests pass** on
`./gradlew :nestsClient:jvmTest --tests HangInteropTest
-DnestsHangInterop=true -DnestsHangInteropTraceRelay=true --rerun-tasks`.

The acceptance bar of the closure roadmap's Priority 1 is met.
Priority 2 (`2026-05-07-tighten-cross-stack-assertions.md`) is now
unblocked; Priority 3 (`2026-05-07-cross-stack-interop-ci-gating.md`)
follows after that.

## Closure (2026-05-07, post-merge)

After the corrected diagnosis below pinned the actor on `:quic`,
five `:quic` commits had landed on `origin/main` between the
session's merge base and pickup. Merging them and re-running the
5× sweep gives:

```
sweep 1: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 5m 9s   (11/11 pass)
sweep 2: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 51s  (11/11 pass)
sweep 3: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 41s  (11/11 pass)
sweep 4: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 35s  (11/11 pass)
sweep 5: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 34s  (11/11 pass)
```

Pre-merge baseline on the same branch (commit `b2a42d9a`, same
TRACE capture, same `--rerun-tasks` shape): **3 fail / 5 sweeps**
(all `late_join_listener_still_decodes_tail`).

Post-merge sample relay trace for the previously-failing scenario
shows the speaker now responding to the upstream SUBSCRIBE in
~1.5 ms:

```
20:14:17.460567  conn{id=0}  subscribe started catalog.json
20:14:17.460585  conn{id=0}  encoding self=Subscribe …catalog.json
20:14:17.462141  conn{id=0}  decoded result=SubscribeOk         ← 1.6 ms RTT
20:14:17.462446  conn{id=0}  decoded result=Group seq=0
```

vs the pre-merge failing trace where the same span had 2.94 s of
silence followed by Ended.

Likely actors among the merged `:quic` commits:

- `b622d0c9 feat(quic): RFC 9001 §6 1-RTT key update` — adds
  `peekKeyPhase` + key-rotation tracking in
  `QuicConnectionParser`. Pre-fix, every short-header packet whose
  KEY_PHASE bit didn't match `currentReceiveKeyPhase` was silently
  AEAD-failed and dropped. While quinn doesn't initiate key updates
  by default, the parser path also touched the short-header
  decoding side, plausibly fixing an adjacent off-by-one in
  short-payload header protection (new test
  `ShortPayloadHeaderProtectionTest.kt` lands alongside).
- `d5c854be fix(quic): PTO retransmits handshake CRYPTO + STREAM`
  — fixes our outbound PTO when the peer never ACKs anything.
  Outbound-only fix, less likely to affect the inbound bidi-data
  parsing side.
- `2a4c07ae fix(quic): thread offered ALPN list through TlsClient
  → ClientHello` — affects handshake; speaker connection had
  already established before the failing bidi arrived, so unlikely
  to be the actor.

The empirical evidence is what counts: **5/5 sweep BUILD
SUCCESSFUL post-merge.** Bisecting WHICH of the 5 commits closes
it can be done if needed for the post-mortem; not necessary to
proceed with the closure roadmap.

## Corrected diagnosis (2026-05-07, post-trace)

5× sweep on `claude/t16-nestsclient-closure-1zBIc` (rustc 1.95,
moq-relay 0.10.25, `-DnestsHangInteropTraceRelay=true`) →
**3 failures / 5 sweeps**, all in
`late_join_listener_still_decodes_tail`. Sweeps 1, 2, 3 failed;
sweeps 4, 5 passed.

For one of the failing runs (sweep 1, broadcast suffix
`6d60532f…`), the relay's full trace + the speaker-side
`Log.d("NestTx")` lines in JUnit `<system-err>` confirm:

```
relay log (conn{id=0} = relay↔speaker, conn{id=1} = relay↔listener)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
18:34:52.085  conn{id=0}  session accepted   (speaker connects)
18:34:52.085  conn{id=0}  encoding AnnounceInterest    (relay → speaker bidi #1)
18:34:52.092  conn{id=0}  decoded Active suffix=6d60…  (speaker replied to AI)
18:34:54.151  conn{id=1}  session accepted   (listener connects, T+2.07 s)
18:34:54.152  conn{id=1}  decoded Subscribe id=0 catalog.json
18:34:54.152  conn{id=1}  subscribed started …catalog.json
18:34:54.152  conn{id=0}  subscribe started id=0 …catalog.json   ← upstream
18:34:54.152  conn{id=0}  encoding Subscribe …catalog.json       ← bidi #2
18:34:57.095  conn{id=0}  decoded Ended suffix=6d60…             ← 2.94 s of silence
                                                                    then speaker tears down
18:34:57.095  conn{id=1}  subscribed cancelled id=0
18:34:57.096  conn{id=0}  subscribe cancelled id=0

speaker NestTx log (matching window)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
18:34:52.092  ANNOUNCE inbound prefix='' → emitted Active suffix='6d60…'
18:34:52.111  send returning false — no inboundSubs (count=1)
18:34:53.111  send returning false — no inboundSubs (count=51)
18:34:54.111  send returning false — no inboundSubs (count=101)
18:34:55.111  send returning false — no inboundSubs (count=151)
18:34:56.111  send returning false — no inboundSubs (count=201)
18:34:57.092  send returning false — no inboundSubs (count=250)
                                                  ↑ NO `SUBSCRIBE inbound` LOG.
```

The relay opens **bidi #2** (peer-initiated bidi from relay TO
speaker) at 18:34:54.152 and writes a complete `Subscribe { id:0,
track:"catalog.json" }` message to it. The wire send succeeds (no
relay-side error). The speaker's `MoqLiteSession.handleInboundBidi`
never logs `SUBSCRIBE inbound id=0 broadcast=…6d60…` — meaning the
bidi never reaches the moq-lite session's bidi pump's
`launch { handleInboundBidi(bidi) }` body. It is silently lost
between the speaker's QUIC stack and the application layer.

The same speaker connection HAS handled bidi #1 (the relay's
AnnounceInterest at 18:34:52.085) correctly — see the
`ANNOUNCE inbound prefix=''` log at 18:34:52.092. So the speaker's
`pumpInboundBidis` is NOT permanently dead; it stops surfacing
peer-opened bidis sometime between T=0 and T+2 s, intermittently.

For comparison, sweep 4's identical scenario (which passed) shows
the relay's bidi #2 → speaker SubscribeOk round-trip in ~1.94 ms:

```
18:42:44.954530  conn{id=0}  encoding Subscribe …catalog.json
18:42:44.956465  conn{id=0}  decoded SubscribeOk
```

So the speaker CAN handle the late-join SUBSCRIBE bidi. It just
sometimes loses it. The 60 % flake rate matches what the prior
investigation observed.

## Why the prior investigation pointed at moq-relay

The prior plan's "smoking gun" trace observed
`ANNOUNCE inbound … emitted Active suffix='<x>'` followed by
**no** further `SUBSCRIBE inbound` for the failing broadcast on
the speaker side, and concluded the relay must have failed to
forward the SUBSCRIBE upstream. That conclusion was correct given
only the speaker-side trace; what we now have — the relay-side
trace from Step 1 capture — shows the relay DID forward, so the
gap is between the wire and the speaker's app code.

The route is therefore not `Origin::announced()` →
`broadcast.subscribe_track(...)` (relay-side) but
`QUIC bidi acceptance` → `WtPeerStreamDemux.readyStreams` →
`QuicWebTransportSession.incomingBidiStreams()` →
`MoqLiteSession.pumpInboundBidis` → `handleInboundBidi`
(speaker-side). One link in that chain drops the second bidi about
40-60 % of the time.

## What to investigate next (out of scope here)

The next agent picking this up should look at:

1. **`:quic` module's `WtPeerStreamDemux`** — the
   `readyStreams = Channel<StrippedWtStream>(Channel.UNLIMITED)`
   and its `consumeAsFlow()` consumer. `consumeAsFlow` is
   single-collector; we already verified only `pumpInboundBidis`
   collects on the speaker side (no `pumpUniStreams` runs on a
   pure publisher), so the single-consumer constraint isn't
   violated, but a peer-bidi that wins the "is this the WT bidi
   prefix or a control stream" classification race might be
   misrouted to a different sink.
2. **WT_BIDI_STREAM prefix stripping under flow control pressure.**
   `emitStripped` (`WtPeerStreamDemux.kt:292-327`) fires
   `readyStreams.trySend(...)`. The path that PREBUFFERS bytes
   between connection acceptance and prefix recognition is the
   most likely place a long-tail bidi gets lost — there's an
   `ArrayDeque<ByteArray> pending` per stream that gets flushed
   into the data Flow only after the prefix is identified.
3. **Concurrent uni-stream openings during the warmup window.**
   The audio publisher's `send()` returns false fast when
   `inboundSubs.isEmpty()` (no uni stream opened), so the speaker
   shouldn't be opening 50 fps of uni streams pre-listener. But
   the audio publisher DOES eventually call
   `endGroup()` on a per-group cadence (every 100 ms at
   framesPerGroup=5/50fps); confirm `endGroup()` is a no-op when
   there's no current group. The trace shows it firing 50 times
   between T=0 and T+5 s.

This rules out **any** test-side mitigation that changes the
moq-relay version, the speaker warmup duration, or the
listener-side subscribe shape — the fault is below moq-lite, in
the QUIC stack's bidi accept path.

## Implications for the closure roadmap

- **Priority 1 of the closure roadmap is misnamed.** It's not
  a moq-relay routing race; it's a `:quic` peer-bidi
  surfacing race. The CI gating (Priority 3) still can't be
  re-enabled until this is fixed, but the fix is in `:quic`,
  not in test code or moq-rs.
- **Priority 2 (tighten cross-stack assertions) is still
  blocked** by the same flake — replacing soft-passes with hard
  floors makes 60 % of sweeps red, same as today.
- **Step 4 of THIS plan (bump moq-relay version) is moot.**
  The bug isn't in moq-relay 0.10.x; it's in our QUIC stack's
  bidi accept under a 2 s warmup. Bumping moq-relay would not
  change this. (Also confirmed: 0.10.25 IS the latest crates.io
  release; main HEAD `bdda6bd1` does not modify
  `recv_subscribe`'s synchronous lookup either.)

## Trace artefact locations

- Per-test relay trace logs:
  `nestsClient/build/relay-logs-sweep-{1..5}/<methodName>-<seq>-<ts>.log`
  (kept on the branch for the next pickup; small enough to commit
  if needed).
- Per-test JUnit XML with speaker `<system-err>`:
  `nestsClient/build/sweep-logs/results-{1..5}/`.
- Per-sweep gradle log (build + first 50 lines of test output):
  `nestsClient/build/sweep-logs/sweep-{1..5}.log`.
- Cross-reference helper:
  `nestsClient/build/sweep-logs/analyze-sweep.sh` (matches by
  test method name).

## Progress log (2026-05-07)

- Step 1 instrumentation landed. `NativeMoqRelayHarness` now accepts an
  optional `testTag` and writes the relay subprocess's combined
  stdout/stderr to
  `nestsClient/build/relay-logs/<methodName>-<seq>-<ts>.log` whenever
  `-DnestsHangInteropTraceRelay=true` is set. The subprocess runs with
  `RUST_LOG=info,moq_relay=trace,moq_lite=trace,moq_native=debug` so
  the per-broadcast subscribe-routing path is observable; quinn /
  rustls / h3 stay at info to keep the file < ~10 MB per scenario.
  `HangInteropTest` and `BrowserInteropTest` now expose a JUnit 4
  `TestName` rule and pass the method name into `resetShared` so each
  scenario's per-method log is easy to locate by name.
- Step 4 ruled out — `cargo info moq-relay` confirms `0.10.25` is the
  current `crates.io` release; no newer minor exists. The plan's
  Step 4 path (next minor on crates.io) does not apply. The fallback
  is a `cargo install --git https://github.com/moq-dev/moq.git --rev
  <main-head>` against `bdda6bd19a37ccdf7f7b66f3d760d8892ea8db59`
  (main HEAD as of investigation) — moq-relay-v0.10.25 tag matches
  the published crate, so post-0.10.25 work lives only on `main`.
  Also note the upstream moved from `kixelated/moq` to `moq-dev/moq`;
  REV's `KIXELATED_MOQ_GIT_REV` predates the move.

### Source-level analysis (moq-rs 0.10.25 + main HEAD)

Working through `moq-relay/src/connection.rs`, `moq-lite/src/lite/publisher.rs`,
`moq-relay/src/cluster.rs` and `moq-lite/src/model/{origin,broadcast}.rs`
the routing path is:

1. Speaker connects → relay's `subscriber.start_announce` runs
   (`moq-lite/src/lite/subscriber.rs:198-227`). It creates the
   `BroadcastDynamic` with `dynamic = 1` BEFORE calling
   `cluster.publisher.publish_broadcast(...)`. publish_broadcast
   pushes to the `primary` origin.
2. `cluster.run_combined()` (`moq-relay/src/cluster.rs:199-215`) is
   a tokio shovel that loops on `primary.announced()` /
   `secondary.announced()` and calls `combined.publish_broadcast(...)`.
   This is the only place primary→combined gets fanned in, and
   `tokio::select!` doesn't run in the same task as start_announce,
   so there's a scheduling gap between primary publish and combined
   publish.
3. Listener connects → relay's `publisher.run_announces` reads from
   `combined.consume_only(...)` and forwards announces over the wire.
4. Listener subscribes → relay's `publisher.recv_subscribe`
   (`moq-lite/src/lite/publisher.rs:217-250`) runs
   `self.origin.consume_broadcast(&subscribe.broadcast)`
   **synchronously** against combined. If the broadcast is in
   combined's tree, returns Some; otherwise None → `Error::NotFound`
   (wire code 13).

Even on main HEAD `bdda6bd1` the `consume_broadcast` lookup is
synchronous (`moq-lite/src/lite/publisher.rs:243-250`). Commit
`8d4a175` only renamed it to `get_broadcast` — same semantics.
Commit `bea9b3a` introduced `OriginConsumer::wait_for_broadcast`
as an async alternative AND added a TODO at
`moq-relay/src/web.rs:325`: "switch to `announced_broadcast`
(bounded by the fetch deadline) so freshly-connected subscribers
don't get a spurious 404 before the broadcast has gossiped." That
is upstream's own acknowledgement that the relay's subscribe path
inherits the gossip race, but the fix has not been applied to
`recv_subscribe` (the path this investigation cares about).

### Failure-mode hypotheses (post-source-read)

- **H1 (gossip race):** still the leading candidate, but with a
  more specific mechanism. The Speaker→Relay primary publish and
  the Relay→Listener combined publish are in different async
  tasks; `consume_broadcast` is synchronous. The listener receives
  the wire ANNOUNCE only AFTER `combined.publish_broadcast(...)`,
  so by the time the listener-issued SUBSCRIBE arrives at the
  relay's `recv_subscribe`, combined SHOULD contain the broadcast.
  But the smoking-gun trace shows the speaker-side never logs the
  upstream SUBSCRIBE for the failing path — i.e. either (a) the
  listener-side ANNOUNCE→SUBSCRIBE wire ordering is being broken
  by something between the relay's combined update and the wire
  emit, or (b) `consume_broadcast` returns None despite combined
  knowing about the broadcast. The trace from Step 1 should
  disambiguate.

- **H1b (`subscribe_track` Cancel due to `dynamic == 0`):**
  `BroadcastConsumer::subscribe_track` returns `Error::NotFound`
  (mapped to wire code 13) if the underlying state's
  `dynamic == 0` (`moq-lite/src/model/broadcast.rs:300-302`).
  start_announce increments `dynamic` BEFORE publish_broadcast,
  so the combined consumer's clone-of-clone-of-broadcast SHOULD
  always observe `dynamic >= 1`. But it relies on `BroadcastConsumer`
  / `BroadcastProducer` sharing the same `state: conducer::Producer`
  cell; if the broadcast got `Clone`d through combined's
  `publish_broadcast`'s `broadcast.clone()` call into a position
  where the state is shared, dynamic stays correct. (Confirmed —
  `BroadcastConsumer::Clone` shares state.) So this isn't the
  cause.

- **H1c (run_combined backlog):** the cluster's run_combined loop
  is a SINGLE-CONSUMER pump from primary.announced(); if the loop
  is parked on a slow combined publish (rare; publish_broadcast is
  effectively a tree insert), a follow-up announce sits in the
  primary queue. But the listener doesn't observe the announce
  via combined until the pump runs — so this doesn't cause a
  spurious subscribe-without-announce. It only delays the
  listener's announce notification.

The trace from Step 1 is needed to pick between H1, H1c, and a
bug we haven't surfaced yet. **Step 4 will not yield a fix** —
verified by reading post-0.10.25 commits on main; no fix to
`recv_subscribe`'s synchronous lookup has landed. The most
viable upstream fix would be to switch `recv_subscribe` to
`origin.wait_for_broadcast(path).await` with a bounded deadline.

**Owns:** the residual flake that affects four T16 scenarios:
`late_join_listener_still_decodes_tail`,
`packet_loss_1pct_does_not_kill_audio`,
`long_broadcast_60s_tone_round_trips`, and the new
`chromium_publisher_*_kotlin_listener_recovers` tests in browser-tier.

**Blocks:** CI gating for `:nestsClient:jvmTest -DnestsHangInterop=true`
and `-DnestsBrowserInterop=true`. Re-evaluate the
`hang-interop` / `browser-interop` workflow jobs once this is closed.

**Cross-refs:**
- `nestsClient/plans/2026-05-07-late-join-catalog-flake-investigation.md`
  (smoking-gun trace + 4 mitigation attempts, 2 of which were
  net-negative and reverted).
- `nestsClient/plans/2026-05-07-i7-post-reconnect-cliff-investigation.md`
  (same kind of routing issue surfacing across publisher cycles).

## What we know

For broadcasts that fail (sample suffixes from the trace:
`10d4b6f2…`, `c75e2648…`, `f1be27ef…`):

1. The Kotlin speaker side logs:
   - `ANNOUNCE inbound prefix='' → emitted Active suffix='<broadcast>'`
   - …then NOTHING for the entire test window.
   - Audio publisher's `send()` repeats `no inboundSubs` at 50 fps
     until the test times out.

2. The Rust hang-listen side logs:
   - `connected, version=moq-lite-03`
   - `broadcast announced path=<broadcast>`
   - `subscribe started id=0 broadcast=<broadcast> track=catalog.json`
   - …then `subscribe error err=remote error: code=0` exactly when
     the speaker tears down at the broadcast-window end (= relay
     forwarding `Cancel`).

The relay accepts the listener's wire SUBSCRIBE on its downstream
connection but **never opens an upstream SUBSCRIBE bidi to the
speaker** for the failing broadcast. The upstream subscribe-pump
that's supposed to forward downstream subscribes to the speaker
isn't wired up by the time the listener subscribes.

For broadcasts that succeed (same trace, same JVM, different test):

```
ANNOUNCE inbound prefix='' → emitted Active suffix=<broadcast>
SUBSCRIBE inbound id=0 broadcast=<broadcast> track='catalog.json'
SUBSCRIBE registered id=0 …
openGroupStream subId=0 seq=0
…
```

All log lines fire; the relay forwards the upstream subscribe
within ~1 ms of the downstream subscribe. Failure mode is binary:
the relay does or does not forward.

## Hypotheses, ranked by next step

### H1 — moq-rs 0.10.x bug in `Origin::announced()` → upstream-pump setup race

`Origin::announced().await` returns the broadcast as soon as the
speaker's announce lands in the relay's origin map. The relay's
upstream-subscribe pump for that broadcast is set up on a separate
async path. If a downstream listener subscribes before the pump is
fully wired, the SUBSCRIBE accepts on the listener's wire (the
relay has the broadcast in its origin) but never propagates
upstream.

**Status:** prime suspect; see "smoking gun" in
`2026-05-07-late-join-catalog-flake-investigation.md`.

### H2 — interaction with the `--auth-public ""` minimal config

The harness boots moq-relay with `--auth-public ""` to skip JWT
issuance. Production runs with full auth. It's possible the
auth-public path takes a different code path through the relay's
origin/subscribe wiring that's racier than the auth'd path.

**Status:** plausible; would explain why the flake isn't reported
against the production deployment.

### H3 — local-only timing race that resolves at higher latency

Loopback (127.0.0.1) has near-zero RTT. The relay's internal
async setup may rely on the natural RTT cushion of a real network
to sequence upstream-subscribe-pump setup vs. downstream-subscribe
acceptance. We bypass that cushion in the test.

**Status:** less likely (the cliff plan's evidence shows lossy
network actually makes things *worse* via the `serve_group` task
pool) but worth ruling out.

## Investigation plan

### Step 1 — capture relay-side traces

`NativeMoqRelayHarness.boot` currently launches `moq-relay` with
`RUST_LOG=info`. Bump to `RUST_LOG=moq_relay=trace,moq_lite=trace`
and capture stderr to a per-test tempfile. Cross-reference with
the failing test's hang-listen stdout AND the speaker-side
`Log.d("NestTx")` traces (already captured in
`<system-err>` per JUnit XML).

Concretely: in `NativeMoqRelayHarness.kt` add a `--log-stderr`
option that the @BeforeTest hook sets to a `<test-method>.log`
path under `nestsClient/build/relay-logs/`. The Kotlin side
already has the speaker-side traces; the Rust side is the gap.

What to look for in the failed-broadcast log:
- Was a SUBSCRIBE bidi opened to the speaker for the failing
  broadcast suffix? (moq_lite span: `subscribe`).
- Did the relay's `Origin::publish_broadcast` call complete
  before the listener's SUBSCRIBE arrived?
- Any `track.unused()` resolves on the publisher-side track that
  would explain immediate cancellation?

### Step 2 — write a minimal reproducer

If Step 1 shows the bug is independent of our test framework,
extract a minimum reproducer:

```rust
// reproducer.rs
let mut cmd = std::process::Command::new("moq-relay")
    .args(&["--server-bind", "127.0.0.1:0", "--auth-public", "",
            "--tls-generate", "localhost"])
    .spawn()?;
// Run a moq-lite SPEAKER on one client, a moq-lite LISTENER on
// another, both pointed at the relay. Listener subscribes immediately
// after the speaker announces. Repeat 100×; count how many succeed.
```

Then strip the SPEAKER's announce timing, the LISTENER's subscribe
timing, the relay's `--auth-public` flag — bisect to the smallest
form that still reproduces.

### Step 3 — file upstream

If Step 1 / 2 confirm a moq-rs bug, file a `kixelated/moq` issue
with:
- The reproducer.
- Smoking-gun trace pair from our test harness.
- Pin to moq-rs version `0.10.25` (per `nestsClient/tests/hang-interop/REV`).
- Cross-link to existing
  `2026-05-01-quic-stream-cliff-investigation.md`'s open follow-up
  #1 (the per-subscriber forward-queue cliff is a sister bug).

### Step 4 — try newer moq-relay version

Bump `MOQ_RELAY_VERSION` in `nestsClient/tests/hang-interop/REV`
and `nestsClient/build.gradle.kts` to the next minor release on
crates.io (whatever's current at the time of pickup). Run the 5×
sweep. If the flake disappears, the upstream may have already
fixed it; we can pin past 0.10.x.

**Risk:** newer moq-relay versions may have wire-format changes
that break our current `moq-lite-03` ALPN pin. The browser
harness's `@moq/lite` 0.2.x client offers `moq-lite-04` AND
`moq-lite-03`, so a newer relay that drops `03` would still
negotiate fine via 04.

## Acceptance criteria

- Sweep `for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do ./gradlew :nestsClient:jvmTest
  --tests HangInteropTest -DnestsHangInterop=true --rerun-tasks; done`
  passes 5/5.
- Browser-tier sweep similarly stable.
- Either:
  (a) Upstream issue filed with reproducer (if the bug is in
      moq-rs and we can't fix it locally), OR
  (b) Local fix applied (e.g. version bump + REV update +
      Cargo.lock regenerate).

## Out of scope

- The `:quic` module's `MAX_STREAMS_UNI` extension fix
  (`d391ae1d`) — already shipped, separate concern.
- The production-side `framesPerGroup` reconciliation
  (`2026-05-07-framespergroup-production-rerun.md`) — independent.
