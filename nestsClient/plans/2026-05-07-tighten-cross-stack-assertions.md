# Plan: tighten cross-stack interop assertions to hard-pass

**Status:** ✅ CLOSED 2026-05-07. Hardened 7 `BrowserInteropTest`
scenarios + the `runBrowserPublishKotlinListen` helper (commits
`04be38ad`, `029329af`). Verification sweep:
**5/5 BUILD SUCCESSFUL × 22/22 tests = 110/110 hard-pass.**
**Depended on:** `2026-05-07-moq-relay-routing-investigation.md`
(closed by `:quic` merge from `origin/main`).

## Why soft passes exist today

Five scenarios currently soft-pass (vacuous-pass on listener-side
0-frame outcomes) to keep the test suite from fail-flaking on the
upstream relay-routing race documented in
`2026-05-07-late-join-catalog-flake-investigation.md`:

| Scenario | File | Soft-pass behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `chromium_listener_late_join_still_decodes_tail` | `BrowserInteropTest.kt` | `if (pcm.size <= warmupSamples) return` |
| `chromium_listener_mid_broadcast_mute_shortens_pcm` | `BrowserInteropTest.kt` | same |
| `chromium_decoder_no_errors_through_warmup_window` (I14) | `BrowserInteropTest.kt` | no `decoderOutputs >= 4` floor |
| `chromium_publisher_baseline_kotlin_listener_decodes` | `BrowserInteropTest.kt` | hard-asserts publisher framesIn; soft-asserts listener |
| `chromium_publisher_reconnect_kotlin_listener_recovers` (Browser I7) | `BrowserInteropTest.kt` | same as baseline |

All five have hard assertions on the `framesIn` / publisher-side
behavior; the listener-side is what's soft. None of these are
reaching their full design intent.

## Soft-pass justification audit (per scenario)

Re-read each scenario's kdoc. The soft-pass is honest right now
(captured 0 frames means harness flake, not regression). Once the
relay-routing race is fixed, the listener side becomes deterministic
and the soft-pass is no longer load-bearing — at that point, the
soft-pass HIDES regressions (a real T8/T11/T13 break could land in
a 0-frame outcome and pass vacuously).

## Tighten plan

### Step 1 — confirm sweep stability

After the routing investigation lands, run:

```
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  echo "=== run $i ==="
  ./gradlew :nestsClient:jvmTest \
    --tests HangInteropTest \
    --tests BrowserInteropTest \
    -DnestsHangInterop=true \
    -DnestsBrowserInterop=true \
    --rerun-tasks 2>&1 | grep -E "FAILED]|BUILD"
done
```

5/5 BUILD SUCCESSFUL with 0 `FAILED` lines = stability achieved.

### Step 2 — replace each soft-pass with a hard floor

For each scenario in the table above, remove the
`if (pcm.size <= warmupSamples) return` short-circuit and replace
with a meaningful sample-count floor. Tighten thresholds based on
observed steady-state numbers (see each scenario's kdoc for what
"steady-state" looks like — most run ≥ 1 s of audio in green-state).

Concretely:

- **Late-join**: `assertTrue(pcm.size >= ...)` floor.
  Steady-state captures ~3 s on a 5 s broadcast with 2 s late-join,
  minus warmup. Threshold: `≥ 1.5 s` — comfortably under the
  steady-state but well over zero.
- **Mute-window**: tighten the upper bound (current 5.5 s) to
  ~5.0 s. Add a lower bound asserting `≥ 2.5 s` — proves audio
  arrived AND the muted segment shortened the total.
- **I14**: re-add `decoderOutputs >= 4` (3 warmup + ≥ 1 audio).
  Current absence-only assertion is partial coverage.
- **Browser publisher baseline + reconnect**: remove the
  vacuous-pass branches, add a `≥ 0.5 s of audio after warmup`
  floor for baseline and `≥ 2.5 s` for reconnect (matches the
  hang-tier I7 threshold).

### Step 3 — reverify

Re-run the 5× sweep. All scenarios must hard-pass 5/5. If a
scenario flakes after tightening, the relay-routing investigation
isn't fully done and we revert the tightening on that scenario
until it is.

### Step 4 — update the gap matrix

`nestsClient/plans/2026-05-06-cross-stack-interop-test-gap-matrix.md`
currently lists I14 with "browser ⏳" pending; flip to "✅" once
its hard floor is in. Same for any I-scenarios that now have
hard floors on both tiers.

## Acceptance criteria

- All BrowserInteropTest scenarios run with hard sample-count
  AND FFT-peak assertions (no `return@runBlocking` short-circuits
  on pcm.size).
- All HangInteropTest scenarios already hard-pass — no change
  needed there.
- Gap matrix updated to reflect hard-pass coverage on each T#.
- Results plan updated to remove the "soft-pass on flake"
  language.

## Outcome (2026-05-07)

| Scenario | Floor landed | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **I2 late-join** | `≥ 1.5 s after warmup` | per plan recommendation |
| **I3 mute-window** | lower `≥ 2.5 s` + upper `< 5.5 s` | upper bound left at 5.5 s; the plan's 5.0 s tightening tripped 5/5 against empirical 5.1–5.2 s steady state |
| **I4 stereo** | `≥ 1 s × 2 ch` | new floor (was vacuous) |
| **I5 hot-swap** | `pcm.size > warmupSamples` | weaker than plan's 0.5 s — Chromium's `@moq/lite` 0.2.x captures only ~100–160 ms post-merge (deferred follow-up: "browser hot-swap re-attach" in `2026-05-06-cross-stack-interop-test-results.md`) |
| **I9 packet-loss** | `≥ 0.5 s after warmup` | per plan recommendation |
| **I14 decoder-no-errors** | `decoderOutputs ≥ 4` | per plan recommendation (3 warmup + ≥ 1 audio) |
| **Browser-publish baseline** | helper hard-asserts | `runBrowserPublishKotlinListen` no longer System.err-prints + returns; uses caller-supplied floor |
| **Browser-publish reconnect** | `≥ 2.5 s` via helper | per plan recommendation |

5/5 sweep × 22 tests = 110/110 hard-pass on
`./gradlew :nestsClient:jvmTest --tests HangInteropTest --tests
BrowserInteropTest -DnestsHangInterop=true -DnestsBrowserInterop=true
--rerun-tasks`.

## Risk: post-tightening flake

If any scenario fail-flakes after tightening, the routing
investigation isn't really done. Don't paper over with a wider
threshold; that's the same trap as the soft-passes. Either:
(a) revert the tightening on that scenario and keep
investigating, OR
(b) widen the threshold ONLY if the new value still excludes
the regression mode the test was designed to catch.
