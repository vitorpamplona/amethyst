/**
 * `connectNestsSpeaker` plus a transport-loss reconnect loop with
 * exponential backoff and proactive JWT refresh. Mirror of
 * [connectReconnectingNestsListener] for the publish side.
 *
 * The returned [NestsSpeaker]'s state surfaces the underlying speaker's
 * state directly while a session is alive, but flips to
 * [NestsSpeakerState.Reconnecting] between attempts. The speaker is
 * auto-redirected to the freshly-opened session under the hood —
 * `startBroadcasting()` returns a stable [BroadcastHandle] whose
 * `setMuted` and `close` survive every refresh.
 *
 * **Why this exists** — moq-auth issues 600 s bearer tokens
 * (`moq-auth/src/index.ts`). Without proactive refresh, any room a
 * user keeps the stage in for >10 min hits an authorisation failure
 * the moment the relay tears down the session, the publish stream
 * goes silent, and the user has to manually re-tap "Talk". The
 * proactive recycle keeps the WebTransport session young so the
 * relay never sees an expired token.
 *
 * **Broadcast-handle re-issuance** — the caller-owned
 * [BroadcastHandle] survives a refresh / reconnect. Internally the
 * wrapper opens a fresh underlying `BroadcastHandle` against each
 * new session, replays the user's mute intent on it, and forwards
 * `setMuted` calls to whichever live handle exists at the time.
 * `close` cancels the re-issue pump and best-effort closes the
 * latest live handle.
 *
 * **Audio gap during refresh — eliminated for moq-lite** — when the
 * underlying speaker implements [HotSwappablePublisherSource]
 * (which [MoqLiteNestsSpeaker] does), the wrapper keeps a single
 * long-lived [com.vitorpamplona.nestsclient.audio.NestMoqLiteBroadcaster]
 * alive across session recycles and only swaps the
 * [com.vitorpamplona.nestsclient.moq.lite.MoqLitePublisherHandle]
 * underneath it. The mic + encoder run continuously through the
 * boundary and the listener hears no silence. The old session
 * close runs in parallel with the new openOnce so the WebTransport
 * teardown doesn't block the swap.
 *
 * **Audio gap during refresh — legacy path** — for speakers that
 * don't implement [HotSwappablePublisherSource] (the IETF reference
 * `DefaultNestsSpeaker` and test fakes), the wrapper falls back to
 * close-then-restart: the listener hears ~50–150 ms of silence per
 * recycle. Acceptable because the IETF path is reference-only —
 * production runs the moq-lite hot-swap path.
 *
 * Cancellation: cancelling [scope] (typically the room screen's VM
 * scope) cancels the reconnect loop and closes both the active
 * session and the active broadcast. [NestsSpeaker.close] is
 * idempotent.
