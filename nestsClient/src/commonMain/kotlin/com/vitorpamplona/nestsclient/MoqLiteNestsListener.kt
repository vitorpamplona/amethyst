/**
 * Moq-lite-backed [NestsListener]. Wraps a connected [MoqLiteSession]
 * and exposes the same listener API the IETF [DefaultNestsListener]
 * does, so [connectNestsListener] can swap the framing layer without
 * changing the public surface that [com.vitorpamplona.amethyst.commons.viewmodels.NestViewModel]
 * and downstream UI consume.
 *
 * Subscription mapping per the audio-rooms NIP draft + nests JS
 * reference (`@moq/watch/broadcast-Djx16jPC.js:6237`,
 * `@moq/publish/screen-B680RFft.js:5641`):
 *   - subscribeSpeaker(pubkey) → MoqLiteSession.subscribe(
 *         broadcast = pubkey, track = "audio/data")
 *   - subscribeCatalog(pubkey) → MoqLiteSession.subscribe(
 *         broadcast = pubkey, track = "catalog.json"). The catalog
 *     publishes one JSON object per group describing the broadcast
 *     (codec, sample rate, optional speaker-side hints). Not
 *     required for audio-only listening — the API exists so a
 *     consumer can show codec / live indicators when wanted.
 *
 * Frame adaptation: each [com.vitorpamplona.nestsclient.moq.lite.MoqLiteFrame]
 * is wrapped in a [MoqObject] so existing decoder / player code keeps
 * working unchanged. moq-lite frames carry no per-frame envelope, so
 * [MoqObject.objectId] is synthesised as a per-subscription monotonic
 * counter and [MoqObject.publisherPriority] uses the IETF default.
