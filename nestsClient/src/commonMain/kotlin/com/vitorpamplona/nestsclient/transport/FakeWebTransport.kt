/**
 * In-memory [WebTransportSession] used by tests for MoQ framing / session logic.
 *
 * A pair of fakes is connected via [pair] — anything written on one side is
 * delivered on the other. This deliberately simulates *success* semantics
 * only (no packet loss, no congestion); the real `:quic`-backed transport
 * exercises those codepaths via its own pipe + interop tests.
 *
 * [incomingDatagrams] and [FakeBidiStream.incoming] use [receiveAsFlow]
 * semantics: a `take(1)` / `first()` followed by a long-running `collect`
 * works on the same underlying channel, and cancelling a consumer does not
 * close the channel for future readers.
