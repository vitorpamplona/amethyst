 * [com.vitorpamplona.nestsclient.transport.QuicWebTransportFactory] which
 * sits on top of the pure-Kotlin `:quic` stack. Keeping this abstract lets
 * us:
 *   - unit-test the MoQ framing layer with [FakeWebTransport],
 *   - swap transport implementations (a different QUIC backend, or a
 *     browser-backed bridge as a contingency) without touching audio/UI
 *     code.
 *
 * Lifecycle: the session is opened via [WebTransportFactory.connect] and must
 * be closed with [close] to release the underlying QUIC connection.
