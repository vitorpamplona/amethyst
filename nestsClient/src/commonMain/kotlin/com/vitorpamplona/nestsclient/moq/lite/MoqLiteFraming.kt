/**
 * Streaming frame buffer for moq-lite. Every wire datum on a control
 * stream is a varint length followed by `length` bytes; every uni
 * stream starts with a one-varint type byte then a size-prefixed
 * group header then a sequence of size-prefixed frames until QUIC FIN.
 *
 * Network reads arrive as opaque chunks, so this class holds a rolling
 * buffer and exposes:
 *   - [readVarint] — pull one varint when enough bytes have arrived
 *   - [readSizePrefixed] — pull one size-prefixed payload (varint
 *     length + payload bytes) when complete
 *
 * Both return null when more bytes are needed; the caller buffers
 * additional chunks via [push] and retries.
 *
 * Not thread-safe — used from a single coroutine per stream.
