/**
 * moq-lite (Lite-03) session for both listener and publisher roles.
 * Wraps a connected [WebTransportSession] and exposes:
 *
 * Listener side:
 *   - [announce] — open an Announce bidi with a prefix, observe live
 *     `Active` / `Ended` updates from the relay.
 *   - [subscribe] — open a Subscribe bidi for a `(broadcast, track)`
 *     pair, await SubscribeOk, return a [MoqLiteSubscribeHandle] whose
 *     [MoqLiteSubscribeHandle.frames] yields each frame the publisher
 *     pushes.
 *
 * Publisher side:
 *   - [publish] — claim a broadcast suffix; the session then services
 *     every relay-opened Announce / Subscribe bidi automatically and
 *     returns a [MoqLitePublisherHandle] the application can push
 *     Opus frames into. Group rollover is the application's call —
 *     [MoqLitePublisherHandle.send] auto-starts a group on first call,
 *     [MoqLitePublisherHandle.endGroup] FINs and starts a new one on
 *     the next send.
 *
 * Wire-protocol scope: Lite-03 — no SETUP, no datagrams, one fresh
 * bidi per request (subscriber → publisher OR publisher accepts from
 * relay), group data on uni streams. See
 * `nestsClient/plans/2026-04-26-moq-lite-gap.md` for the byte-level
 * layout.

        //      — collector exits, runs `remove(id)` against an empty
        //      map, no-ops; subscribe() then inserts; the frames
        //      channel is now in the map with no live collector to
        //      close it on transport tear-down. Consumer hangs
        //      forever. Pre-registering means the collector's
        //      idempotent remove+close cleanup always finds and
        //      closes the frames channel, regardless of timing.
        //
        //   2. First-group race (audit fix #3): the relay can open
        //      the first group's uni stream BEFORE our subscribe()
        //      continuation re-enters [state] to register `id`. If
        //      the SUBSCRIBE bytes hit the wire before the map entry
        //      lands, [drainOneGroup] looks the id up against an
        //      empty map and silently drops the frame. Registering
