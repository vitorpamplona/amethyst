/**
 * Inverse of [NestPlayer]: pulls PCM from an [AudioCapture], runs it
 * through an [OpusEncoder], and pushes the resulting Opus packets into a
 * [MoqSession.TrackPublisher] as MoQ OBJECT_DATAGRAMs.
 *
 * One instance per outgoing track (typically one per local speaker, since
 * Opus encoder state is per-stream).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - [start] opens the mic, starts the capture-encode-publish loop.
 *   - [setMuted] keeps the loop running but stops emitting frames so unmute
 *     is instant. Default unmuted.
 *   - [stop] cancels the loop, stops the mic, releases the encoder, and
 *     closes the publisher.
 *
 * Encoder warm-up frames (encoder returns empty) are dropped silently.
 * Encode failures are reported via [onError] but do NOT tear the loop down —
 * one bad frame shouldn't end the broadcast.
