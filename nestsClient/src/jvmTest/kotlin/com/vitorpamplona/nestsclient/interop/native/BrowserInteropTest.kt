     *
     *   1. `@moq/hang` 0.2.4 (the published version pinned in
     *      `nestsClient/tests/browser-interop/package.json`) does not export
     *      the high-level `Container.Consumer` / `Format` API. Phase 4
     *      uses `Container.Legacy.Consumer` directly — same data path
     *      `@moq/watch` uses internally for `container.kind = "legacy"`.
     *   2. `framesPerGroup = 50` against the local `moq-relay 0.10.25
     *      --auth-public ""` harness hits the per-subscriber forward
     *      cliff documented in
     *      `2026-05-07-framespergroup-reconciliation.md` — the relay
     *      forwards the `Group` control header but holds the frame
     *      payload, so no audio reaches the listener at all. Production
     *      uses `framesPerGroup = 50`; locally we pin `5` to bypass
     *      the local-relay-specific cliff and still exercise the
     *      browser path's long-haul behaviour.
     *
     * What this catches that I1 forward (browser, 10 s) doesn't:
     *   - Chromium WebTransport `MAX_STREAMS_UNI` credit drift over
     *     thousands of unidirectional streams (60 s × 10 streams/s =
     *     600 streams; far past the connection's initial window),
     *   - `@moq/hang` `Container.Legacy.Consumer` group-queue eviction
     *     (`MAX_GROUP_AGE = 30 s` in moq-rs; we pass that bound twice),
     *   - WebCodecs `AudioDecoder` pacing + memory pressure across a
     *     real broadcast-length capture window.

/**
 * Run a Chromium publisher (`publish.ts`) against a Kotlin listener
 * driven by [connectReconnectingNestsListener].
 *
 * Used by the I7 reverse scenario (with [reconnectAfterMs] > 0) and
 * the baseline scenario (with [reconnectAfterMs] = 0).
 *
 * **Hard assertions (publisher side):**
 *   - Playwright (`publish.html`) reaches `state="done"` and exits 0.
 *   - The page emits ≥ [minPublisherFramesIn] encoded frames
 *     (from `__framesIn` in the meta JSON).
 *   - If [reconnectAfterMs] > 0, the page reports `cycles >= 1`
 *     (= the reconnect logic fired).
 *
 * **Soft assertions (listener side):**
 *   - If the listener captured ≥ [minSamplesAfterWarmup] decoded
 *     mono PCM samples after warmup, assert the 440 Hz peak.
 *   - Otherwise, vacuous-pass with a stderr note. The captured
 *     count is harness-flaky on the listener side because of
 *     moq-relay 0.10.x's per-broadcast subscribe-routing race
 *     (documented in `2026-05-07-late-join-catalog-flake-investigation.md`)
 *     — the relay accepts the listener's wire SUBSCRIBE but
 *     intermittently doesn't open the upstream subscribe to the
 *     publisher. A T8 / T11 / T13 regression on the publisher side
 *     would still trip the FFT on whichever runs DO get listener
 *     data.
 *
 * The reconnecting-listener wrapper is essential here even for the
 * non-reconnect baseline: Chromium's cold-launch eats 3-10 s before
 * the publisher is alive, and during that window the listener's
 * first subscribe attempts fail with "subscribe stream FIN before
 * reply". The wrapper retries with exponential backoff until the
 * subscribe lands.
