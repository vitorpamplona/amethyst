/**
 * Test fixture that boots a local nostrnests stack via Docker Compose so
 * `:nestsClient`'s production code can be exercised end-to-end against
 * the reference server (https://github.com/nostrnests/nests).
 *
 * Mirrors the pattern used by `:quic`'s `InteropRunner` against aioquic:
 *
 *   - opt-in via `-DnestsInterop=true` system property; default test runs
 *     skip via `assumeNestsInterop()` so CI without Docker stays green
 *   - clones the nostrnests repo at a pinned commit on first use, caches
 *     under `~/.cache/amethyst-nests-interop/`
 *   - brings up `docker compose -f docker-compose-moq.yml up -d` (auth
 *     sidecar on host port 8090, MoQ relay on 4443 TCP+UDP)
 *   - port-probes both services until they accept connections
 *   - tears the stack down via `docker compose down -v` on [close]
 *
 * One harness instance per test class — startup is ~30-60 s, so amortise
 * across as many cases as possible.
